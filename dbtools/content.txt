INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION
Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a fast-paced tabletop miniatures game that pits teams of elite specialists,
ragtag zealots and hard-bitten veterans against one another in vicious battles to the death. Draw your
blades, check your ammo, mutter a quick prayer to your gods and get ready to join the fight!

SQUAD VERSUS SQUAD
Games of Kill Team revolve around vital conflicts
between small but powerful bands of warriors rather
than huge armies. They are an opportunity to tell
cinematic tabletop stories in which every single
combatant counts, and every model you command
develops their own personality and history.

Can the enemy’s leader be eliminated before he can
reach – and activate – the doomsday weapon? Can your
scouting force sever the enemy’s lines of communication
and get clear before they are caught? Will the freshly
deployed squad of elite specialists be taken down by the
battle-hardened band of veterans, and will the eagle-
eyed sniper take down his tenth kill in a row? These and
countless other narratives await to be uncovered!

In this book, you will find all the background
information and tabletop rules required to dive
headlong into the world of Kill Team. The following
pages are replete with examples of the sorts of kill
teams that might be assembled. You will see some of the
apocalyptic war zones through which such warbands
fight, and how their desperate fire fights and vicious

battles can be every bit as impactful upon the fates of
worlds as can the onslaught of massed regiments or
super-heavy engines of war.

Reading on, you will find a wealth of narrative
information and random tables for many of the major
Warhammer 40,000 factions. Intended to provide
collectors with a wide range of exciting inspiration,
these tables present various types of kill team that
each faction might field, the sorts of missions they
might be sent upon, as well as the strange personality
quirks that their warriors and leaders might possess.
These sections are designed to be toolkits from which
players can draw as little or much as they like – one
collector may roll up every aspect of their kill team and
choose to play in character upon the tabletop in order
to get a truly narrative experience, while another may
simply use these tables as idea-fuel for conversions or
kill team designs.

clash in savage battle with the Necrons known as the Exalted Scythe.

Finally, this book provides a full suite of rules
for playing a wide variety of skirmish-level Kill
Team battles.

Alongside the rules to create your kill teams, you will
also find an array of custom scenarios perfectly suited to
squad-on-squad battles to the death. There are also sets
of Kill Team tactics to evoke everything from a sniper’s
killer headshot to an unhinged knifeman’s rampage,
and even a full campaign system during which your kill
teams can advance their skills, gain new warriors and
wargear, and conquer swathes of different territories
in the war to take control of a sprawling Imperial hive
city. By combining these mechanics with narrative
inspiration from the background tables, your gaming
group can enjoy a truly unique and personal hobby
experience that will generate war stories you’ll talk
about for years to come!

KILL TEAMS
Creating a kill team can be as simple as purchasing
a single box of Citadel Miniatures, assembling and
painting them to a standard you’re happy with,
and getting ready to play. On the other hand, some
hobbyists derive great satisfaction from melding
multiple troop types into a single, cohesive warband.
They model, convert and paint up every individual
figure to have its own aesthetic, personality and
equipment to bring to battle. Many players enjoy
the narrative element of this sort of project, drawing
inspiration from their favourite codex or Black Library
novel, from esoteric aspects of the Warhammer 40,000
universe, or even from Warhammer 40,000 computer
games. There is a real thrill in painstakingly recreating
a favourite band of warriors from a book or game and
seeing them come to life on the tabletop. In either

case, the tables of background traits, team missions,
pre-generated names and more found later in this book
will go a long way towards helping even a first-time
hobbyist create a unique character and backstory for
their kill team.

In Kill Team battles, every warrior in your warband is
a vital link in the chain. Even the lowliest Grot or Astra
Militarum Conscript can fire the shot that makes the
difference between glorious victory and ignominious
defeat. However, certain figures amongst the ranks of
every kill team deserve a special mention. These are the
team’s leader and its specialists.

Kill team Leaders direct their warriors in the field.
Whether they are tyrannical monsters or disciplined line
officers, hard-bitten survivors or zealous demagogues,
these individuals are the exemplars of their respective
kill teams, and in many ways form the embodiment of
the player upon the battlefield. Many kill team Leaders
have access to powerful weapons and specialised
wargear that allow them to cut a path of ruin through an
enemy warband, and it is their leadership, force of will
and authority that keeps the kill team fighting when the
odds are against them.

Specialists, meanwhile, are warriors who excel in a
single area, typically armed with the sort of weaponry
that allows them to make the most of their skills. Sharp-
shooting snipers whose powerful firearms can take an
enemy’s head off from across the battlefield; masterful
bladesmen whose thrumming power swords have
tasted the blood of a hundred foes; madcap demolitions
experts with belts full of explosives and a crazed gleam
in their eye; all of these and many more embody the
specialists that can be added to a kill team in order to
give it powerful, battle-winning abilities.

KILL TEAM TOKENS
The Kill Team Starter Set box and the Kill Team
Faction Starter Set boxes each come with a set of
tokens for use in your games of Kill Team.

You do not need these tokens to play Kill Team, but
if you have a set you’ll find the tokens shown on the
right to be a very useful way of keeping track of which
of your warriors have done what in each battle round.
The core rules explain when each token is used, and
what significance it has.

You’ll also find the objective markers included in each
set of tokens useful in your games of Kill Team, where
they can represent areas or items of vital importance
to your mission.

SHADOW WAR

SHADOW WAR
‘One blade, driven into the correct

heart, at the right moment, will
save or slay a world as surely as the

firepower of entire armies.’
- Warmaster Hokaeto,

Supreme Imperial Commander, Des-
maxian Crusade





Squad Warfare

SQUAD WARFARE
A single squad of warriors, well equipped and well trained, can tip the balance of a war. Whether daring
assassins, hawk-eyed scouts or grizzled veterans out for revenge, these warriors can alter the destiny of
entire planets through their efforts.

DARK IMPERIUM
The Warhammer 40,000 setting is a sprawling and
horrific dystopia where all is war. For ten millennia,
battle has raged from one end of the galaxy to the other,
fought across countless strange worlds, between myriad
factions and races. Though planets without number
have burned in the name of victory or vengeance, still
there is no end in sight to the killing. If anything, the
galaxy grows darker by the day.

Scattered across the stars, the Imperium of Mankind
fights wars beyond count. The Space Marines, the Astra
Militarum, the Adeptus Mechanicus and more battle
furiously for the survival of their species, offering praise
to the Emperor – or his Machine Cult equivalent, the
Omnissiah – for every victory. The Imperium is the
single largest empire in the galaxy and its military might
is colossal, yet it is assailed from without and within;
only faith, hatred and a never-ending butcher’s bill of
martyred soldiery keeps Humanity from being overrun.

Even as the Emperor’s servants fight to preserve the
Imperium, so the worshippers of the Chaos Gods pour
all their hatred, fury and obsession into tearing it down.
Ten thousand years ago, the terrible schism known as
the Horus Heresy split the Emperor’s realm, fully half of
the mighty Space Marine Legions pledging their souls
to the Dark Gods of Chaos in return for power, glory
or revenge. Though they were defeated at the siege of
the Emperor’s Palace on Terra, the Traitor Legions have
never given up their Long War against the Imperium
that made them – if anything, they fight with more
bitterness and cruelty now than they ever did in the
dim and distant past. The Heretic Astartes are dark
mirrors of the Emperor’s noble Space Marines, their
ranks twisted by mutation and riddled with corruption.
Such forces as the diseased Death Guard and sorcerous
Thousand Sons lead their attack, while hidden cults
scramble to do their masters’ bidding, desperate for the
promise of fleeting power.

Though it is the war between the Imperium and the
forces of Chaos that sets the stars aflame, these are
far from the only warring factions in this dark galaxy.
Alien hordes of every stripe surge into battle, looking
to expand their empires or crush their hated foes. From
beneath the surface of ancient worlds, the android
Necrons rise up to butcher the living and reclaim
their demesnes of old. From the webway – the strange

labyrinth dimension that lies between realspace and the
warp – come the enigmatic Aeldari, hosts and raiding
parties of Asuryani, Drukhari and Harlequins spreading
death and mayhem for reasons only they comprehend.
Barbaric hordes of Orks and ravenous Tyranid swarms
scour entire worlds of life. Genestealer Cults stage
vicious uprisings. The T’au Empire annexes one world
after another.

For ten thousand years, the galactic war has waxed and
waned. Yet in the closing years of the 41st Millennium
the mayhem and bloodshed has grown worse after the
Great Rift – a roiling mass of warp storms like a great
wound in reality – split the galaxy in two. One half
has been plunged into darkness, while the other still
clings to the radiance of the Emperor’s light. The fight
for survival and domination spirals towards outright
madness, and worlds shudder to the tread of endless
invading armies.

Yet not every conflict is apocalyptic in scale, and it is not
always the largest army that carries the day. Sometimes,
amidst the screaming madness and billowing flames
of the wider war, victory or defeat lies in the hands
of a small band of heroes or villains, hell bent upon
achieving their mission at any cost.

BEHIND ENEMY LINES
The battles fought by kill teams take many forms.
Sometimes a vital enemy commander, demagogue priest
or dangerous witch must be slain by a sniper’s bullet or
glinting blade from the shadows. Alternatively, a vital
strategic asset may need to be eliminated, be it an enemy
command centre, the generator for a bank of void
shields, the control matrix for an orbital defence battery
or a foul shrine to the Dark Gods.

Other battles may see a band of embattled scouts
attempting to reach friendly lines, bearing vital strategic
information that must reach their masters at any
cost. Perhaps the enemy’s communications or supply
routes need to be cut off before a major offensive can
begin. Some kill teams are deployed to scout the foe’s
strength prior to battle, to locate and eliminate enemy
patrols, or simply to wreak as much havoc upon the
foe’s infrastructure as they can, blowing up targets of
opportunity wherever the chance presents itself.

Other kill teams may fight wholly different kinds of
battles. A small band of warriors may find themselves
the only line of defence between teeming hordes of
evacuees and a rapidly approaching murder squad. Two
opposed squad leaders may develop a bitter rivalry that
can only be settled by a blade-to-blade clash in no man’s
land. A handful of heroes may set out on a holy crusade
that only they can complete, or a band of roguish
opportunists may descend upon a war-ravaged world to
loot whatever they can.

‘Forward scouts report heavy resistance.
Infantry elements bogged down amidst the
Imperatus manufactorum complex. Colonel
Diert’s outflanking armour driven back by enemy
super-heavy engines along the Kalterwash.
Strategos predicts insufficient time to mass a
suitable offensive before xenos super-weapon is
triggered. Recommend deployment of Archangel
Team by Valkyrie drop-insertion. Emperor protect
us, my lords, they are now our only hope.’

- Last strategic missive before official sanction of Oper-
ation Aquila Rising

In all instances, battles between kill teams tend towards
close-quarters firefights through tangled terrain. They
are desperate and bloody affairs that see deeds of
incredible heroism and breathtaking savagery enacted
on a close and personal scale.

Warriors sprint headlong from one patch of cover to
the next, leaning out to spray fire at half-seen enemies
amongst the ruins and the undergrowth. Blade-wielding
killers lope through the shadows, slipping into the ideal
position from which to launch their attack.

Grinning heavy-weapons troopers heft their massive
firearms and let fly, their hails of firepower rendering
them every bit as lethal as a mainline battle-tank would
be in a larger-scale conflict. Hand-picked special forces
advance methodically, laying down ferocious covering
fire as their comrades push towards their objectives.

Grenadiers chuckle maniacally to themselves as they
prime bandoleers of explosives before hurling them
into the enemy’s midst to raise thunderous detonations.
Grim field surgeons dash from one fallen comrade to

the next, pumping stimulants into wounded bodies
and offering mercy to those too injured to press on. All
the while, guns thunder and steel clashes with hungry
ferocity, both sides fighting with everything they have.

Every battle between rival kill teams tells a tale of
heroism and adventure, desperation and cruelty. Every
shot, every blade-stroke and hurled grenade counts,
every moment of sudden inspiration or low cowardice
can mean the difference between victory and defeat.
With the fates of armies, war zones and worlds at stake,
battle becomes ever more desperate, for only one side
can prevail.

A GALAXY VAST AND DARK…
It is the 41st Millennium, and the human race
stands upon a precipice. Ruled by the immortal
Emperor from his Golden Throne on Terra, the
Imperium of Mankind stretches out to the very
fringes of the galaxy. The Imperium is assailed from
within and without by the alien, the mutant and the
heretic. For all its might, this empire is crumbling:
its worlds are scattered and often isolated; its vast
martial strength is fettered by bloated bureaucracy;
its people are controlled through ignorance, fear
and superstition. Only the guiding light of the
Emperor holds the Imperium together, the psychic
beacon of the Astronomican guiding Mankind’s
ships through the darkness of the void.

Those ships travel through the warp, the hellish
dimension of raw psychic energy that lurks
beneath the skin of realspace. By plunging into
the tides of the warp, spacecraft can travel vast
distances in a fraction of the time they might
otherwise take. Moreover, it is by manipulating
the energies of the warp that the psychic mutants
known as Astropaths can communicate across the
vast gulfs between Imperial worlds. Yet the warp is
not a sterile plane; by its very nature, warp energy
is pernicious and mutative, while its depths are
inhabited by myriad predatory abominations that
Mankind has come to know as Daemons.

The warp has always posed a terrible threat, its
energies spilling into the galaxy in ferocious
storms, its denizens seeking to subvert and
conquer realspace. Yet in the closing years of the
41st Millennium a storm like no other has torn its
way across the stars. Known as the Great Rift, this
catastrophic phenomenon has split the Imperium
almost in two, leaving countless worlds cut off
from the Astronomican. So has the war for survival
become more desperate than ever before.

Heroes All

HEROES ALL
Every kill team is different, but all have certain features in common. Each is directed by a determined
leader. Each also contains a handful of skilled specialists whose martial abilities make them vital assets in
the field, supporting the remainder of the kill team’s soldiers and leading them to victory.

Kill teams are assembled for a vast variety of different
missions, many of which simply could not be completed
by a larger and less specialised force. Some are assassins
or saboteurs, using stealth or rapid-deployment
technologies to strike without warning at targets far
behind enemy lines. Where a larger force would quickly
be detected by sentries or be forced into engagements
with defending forces, a kill team can slip quietly into
position, silence any who might stand in their way, and
then strike the killing blow. Many an apostate cardinal
or xenos war-leader has discovered too late that their
inner sanctum was far less safe than they believed as
doors have blown in, guards have been gunned down
and the kill team’s warriors have put their target to the
sword. Countless shield generators, doomsday weapons
and summoning circles have been blown sky-high by
demolitions charges planted by elite operatives.

Other kill teams are protectors rather than destroyers.
Their mission may be to escort a vital dignitary through
the blazing hell of no man’s land, or to provide skilled
sentries for a hidden arco-laboratory or church of the
faith. It may be to watch over a crucial hidden passage

A kill team of Tempestus Scions advances on their
objective, hot-shot lasguns blazing.

through a fortress’ otherwise impenetrable defences, to
hunt enemy infiltrators amidst ruined manufactorums,
or to stand as a final line of defence before the command
sanctum from within which an entire war front is being
controlled. Whatever the case, the hand-picked warriors
of the kill team must ensure that their duty is discharged
no matter the odds they face.

Other kill teams receive even more esoteric assignments:
the ritualised slaughter of specific targets in order to
summon daemonic entities, lacing an enemy army’s
rations with mutagenic gene-poisons, or painting a
quarry with psycho-receptive resonators in preparation
for a catastrophic psychic bombardment. The list is
endless, with every mission being more vital, dangerous
and challenging than the last.

In some cases, a team is assembled intentionally to
fulfil a specific mission or achieve a particular goal.
They may include an ideal spread of combatants for the
task at hand, and carry precisely the correct equipment
and munitions to eliminate their targets. Deathwatch
kill teams, squads of combat-optimised Skitarii and
perfectly balanced Asuryani assassination bands are
good examples of these sorts of forces.

On other occasions, kill teams may be formed in the
field. A hard-bitten squad of Astra Militarum Veterans
might band together to survive an especially savage war
zone; a group of Adeptus Astartes warriors might find
themselves joining forces to combat an onrushing horde
of enemies; a handful of murderous Night Lords might
coordinate their efforts in order to spread terror and
death through an Imperial command complex.

Many kill teams are drawn wholesale from amongst
the ranks of a larger army in the field, and assigned
a specific mission that they must complete before
returning to their comrades. Whether it be a mob
of Ork Kommandos sent to blow up the enemy’s
ammunition dumps, a combat squad of Ultramarines
assigned as an honour guard to the shrine of an
Imperial Saint, or a band of Kabalite Warriors charged
with upholding the reputation of their Archon through
feats of arms, such groups have the advantage of having
fought as one in many conflicts. Though they may lack
the diversity of specialists available to a more mixed
kill team, their warrior bond and clearly defined way of
making war stand such kill teams in good stead when
the fighting intensifies.

10



THE BEST OF THE BEST
Regardless of a kill team’s origins and composition,
it will always be directed in battle by an especially
charismatic, cunning or domineering individual. Some
of these leaders enact their will through the respect
of their warriors or the rank invested in them by their
military station. Others, such as the Boss Nobz that rule
over Ork mobs, take charge by dint of being the biggest
and toughest, able to clobber any of the ladz who do
not follow their orders to the letter. Still others ply the
lash of fear, or command absolute obedience through
mind control or sacred religious station. Whichever
holds true, a kill team’s leader is both its brain and its
heart, the strategic mastermind who ensures that their
warriors fight in the optimum fashion and hold their
ground when the odds are against them.

Specialists are the other asset common to every kill
team. Though they can take many forms – from master
assassin to berserk killer, volatile pyromaniac to wily
trapper – these skilled individuals bring vital equipment
and talents to the battlefield. While every warrior within
a kill team matters, and all can win victory with their
comrades through sufficient faith and fortune, it is the
specialists who most often land the killing blow.

The longer a kill team fights together, and the more
missions that they successfully complete, the more
deadly a military force they become. Warriors initially
thrown together by fate, or the orders of distant
superiors, learn to fight seamlessly alongside one
another. They become adept at anticipating each other’s
actions, and build bonds of loyalty that see them fight
harder than ever when they do so side-by-side.

Many teams develop private combat languages, be
they subtle inflections, hand signals or encoded vox-
clicks, that allow them to communicate stealthily and
efficiently when fighting behind enemy lines. Such kill
teams are united by victories and defeats shared, by
hardships faced and comrades lost; many will affect
ad hoc markings or honour badges in remembrance
of their greatest – or darkest – hours. While they
may become insular and hostile towards outsiders, or
difficult for their superior officers to handle, long-
serving kill teams also build well-deserved reputations
as elite military assets, best deployed when no one else
can get the job done.

As kill teams gain experience, so too do their leaders
and their specialists reach ever higher levels of personal
skill. Commanders that at first were daunted by their
role become bellowing firebrands or shrewd strategists
whose authority over their warriors is absolute. Snipers
become increasingly accurate until they can thread a
shot through the smallest gap and fell their victim every
time. Close-combat specialists become more dangerous
with each battle they survive, some transforming into
sublimely skilled and elegant killers, while others
degenerate into scarred berserkers that cut notches
into their gore-stained weapons for each enemy slain.
Explosives experts become artists of destruction,
zealots find the fires of their faith burning ever higher,
heavy weapons troopers become engines of slaughter
and field-medics become adept at swiftly and calmly
restoring even catastrophically wounded warriors to
fighting efficiency.

So do kill teams grow into legendary bands of warriors,
heroes or villains about whom tales are told and legends
spun. The rivalries between such squads are fierce
indeed, and the ferocious battles they engage in are
amongst the most dynamic and close-fought conflicts of
the 41st Millennium.

KILL TEAM AGRIPPIUS
During the war for Tholdax, the Imperial advance
stalled amidst the war-torn streets of Hive
Ganymede. Though they outnumbered the traitor
forces three-to-one, the Astra Militarum could not
contend with the incredible tactical acumen of the
heretics’ leader, a champion of the Alpha Legion
known as the Serpent’s Shadow. This devious
figure was marked for death, the job falling to a
hand-picked band of Ultramarines battle-brothers
known as Kill Team Agrippius.

The team’s leader, Sergeant Agrippius, was
renowned for his steely will and ability to push
his brothers on to deeds that seemed remarkable,
even for post-human Space Marines. This effect
was all the more pronounced considering the
exceptional skill of the specialist warriors within
the squad’s ranks. Brother Crassus was the team’s
demolitions expert, who used his timed krak-
charges to cripple the unmarked APC in which the
Alpha Legion target travelled. To Brother Ignatio,
the squad’s marksman, fell the job of gunning
down the target’s bodyguards, a task which he
fulfilled admirably as he made shot after pinpoint
shot through the eyepieces of their helms as they
disembarked. Finally, the coup de grâce was landed
by Brother Taurian, who blew the stranded APC –
and the target inside – sky-high with his reverently
maintained missile launcher.

Theatres of War

THEATRES OF WAR
The galaxy is vast, and in this dark age there is precious little of its immense span that does not echo to the
sound of gunfire and burn with the fires of war. Yet even amongst this whirling maelstrom, certain war
zones have a reputation for their size and ferocity.

From storm-tossed ocean planets and hellish jungle-
covered death worlds to ruined cityscapes, fortified
strongholds and even the claustrophobic corridors
of derelict spacecraft, kill teams go into action across
myriad different battlefields. Each brings its own
variety of conditions, challenges and opportunities for
a cunning commander and their skilled followers to
exploit. Each also plays host to dangers untold.

The supreme commanders of the 41st Millennium have
incredible military forces at their disposal. Entire fleets
of deep-space battleships clash above war-torn worlds,
disgorging wave upon wave of invading warriors in
cavernous landing craft. Brigades of heavily armoured
fighting vehicles clash across cratered plains. Vast
hordes of infantry meet in desperate battle, while fighter
craft and wings of bombers duel overhead.

Yet there are many scenarios in which the precise
application of a small but highly trained force can
garner far greater success than the sledgehammer
deployment of massed armies. Many missions must
be accomplished in secrecy, while for other conflicts
the element of surprise is as valuable a weapon as any
amount of heavy artillery. On Prassima V, a kill team of
Alpha Legionnaires used the shrine world’s long-defunct
network of holy water aqueducts to bypass thousands
of zealot militia and strike directly at Cardinal Munce.
Emerging into the cardinal’s spire-top gardens, the
traitors ambushed the squad of White Consuls Space
Marines charged with guarding Munce’s life. The
loyalists fought hard but, out of position and taken
by surprise in their inner sanctum, they were slain.
Munce was left dangling upside down amidst his own
entrails from the crook of the statue of Saint Katherine,
while the Alpha Legionnaires’ escape was covered by
explosive booby traps that they left in their wake to
be triggered by frantic militiamen. The same kill team
struck a further three times, fanning the flames of panic
and anger until Prassima V was consumed by a vicious
internecine holy war.

Sometimes, a commander must wield kill teams and
massed forces in concert, the one paving the way to
victory for the other. On Stenoth, during the Wars of
Admonishment, the Imperial advance was stymied by a
preposterously immense Ork fortress known as Gork’s
Gut. A city-sized edifice that – at its highest points –
broke the upper atmosphere, Gork’s Gut was wreathed
in kustom force fields and defended by millions of Orks.

The first two Imperial offensives were crushing failures,
the Emperor’s armies flung back by the sheer weight
of firepower and the ablative, scrap-metal resilience
of the fortress’ structure. Before the third wave went
in, several kill teams of Blood Angels Primaris Space
Marines deployed onto the structure’s topmost towers,
swiftly vanishing into its enormity on targeted missions.
Though the Blood Angels faced stern opposition
from mobs of Ork Nobz and greenskin Kommandos,
they succeeded in knocking out the fortress’ shield
generators, demolishing its main gate from within, and
assassinating – at steep cost in lives – the Orks’ warlord.
When the final Imperial attack was launched, it surged
to victory thanks to the kill teams’ efforts.

Thousands more war zones have seen drastic changes in
fortune after a kill team struck a crushing blow, while in
others the very nature of the terrain or the conditions
makes the deployment of kill teams far more effective
than sending in armies. The tangled arboreal world
of Lucifere II, for example, is all but unnavigable for
anything larger than infantry on foot. Yet it is here that
Gunnery Sergeant ‘Stonetooth’ Harker and his notorious
Catachan Devils hunted down and exterminated a slew
of Tyranid vanguard broods, any of which could have
called down a full-scale Tyranid invasion upon the
life-rich world.

The cramped tunnelplexes of Elboryth are another
war zone where kill teams prove particularly effective.
Here, raiding bands of Drukhari, Adepta Sororitas and
Necrons do constant battle as they attempt to wrest
control of the planet’s buried catacombs – and the riches
that lie within – from each other.

While all-out war ravages the forge world of Ryza,
smaller but no less deadly conflicts rage daily through
the rear lines of both the Adeptus Mechanicus and the
Orks. On one hand, raiding parties of Skitarii seek to
sabotage greenskin war engines and assassinate their

12



leaders. On the other, Ork Kommandos strike at crucial
production sites and steal prototype weaponry for their
Meks to cannibalise. Thus do the kill teams of both races
aid their war efforts.

Many Imperial worlds boast sprawling hive cities or
industrial macroplexes that stretch over continents,
and that rapidly devolve into labyrinthine hellscapes
once war consumes them. Kill teams excel in such
conditions; they can move quickly through the ruined
streets, flitting between bombed-out buildings, warriors
covering each other as they move from one outcropping
of twisted wreckage to the next. Snipers and heavy
weapon specialists clamber up to vantage points amidst
the looming skeletons of burned-out manufactorums
and refinery plants. Combat experts dash from one
smouldering crater to the next, rapidly closing on their
foes even as courageous warriors scramble through
rusting pipes and leap between teetering ruins to
outflank the enemy’s position.

Jungle worlds are host to many types of environments
amongst which kill teams often do battle. Where
bladed throttlevines and fang trees cluster close amidst
sheer-sided ravines, where craggy mountain slopes or

festering marshes are densely carpeted by carnivorous
plant-life, kill teams demonstrate worth far beyond their
numbers. Where battle tanks or massed infantry would
flounder and fail, a kill team can slip on towards their
objectives. Ambushes, booby traps and bladework rule
such battlefields, with warriors forced to cut their way
through hostile – and sometimes sentient – undergrowth
before coming suddenly face-to-face with the foe.

Even upon the most sweeping and apocalyptic of
battle-fronts, kill teams find many uses. Where Imperial
trenchworks or heretical fortifications stretch to the
horizon in all directions, where super-heavy war
engines hurl munitions at one another from miles
apart and massed attack waves clash in the blood and
horror of no man’s land, a subtle and well-placed blade
may achieve what thousands of screaming warriors
cannot. Command bunkers vanish in sudden fireballs
as kill team charges detonate. Ammunition shipments
or messenger drones vanish without trace, leaving
entire regiments paralysed. Artillery strikes are called
in with shocking accuracy by unseen spotters. Whole
armies strike from unexpected quarters thanks to
summoning rituals or teleportation rites performed by
infiltrating elements.

Operating well ahead of the main T’au battle line, a team of Pathfinders marks out Imperial supply caches for
devastating bombing runs by Sun Shark aircraft.

Core Rules

CORE RULES
Kill Team puts each player in command of a force of hand-picked fighters tasked with a vital mission. The core
rules on these pages contain everything you need to know in order to use your Citadel Miniatures to wage covert
war against one or more opponents for control of the battlefields of the 41st Millennium.

TOOLS OF WAR
In order to play a game of Kill Team, you will need your
Citadel Miniatures, a tape measure, a playing surface
(which could simply be a table), and some dice. You
may also find it helpful to have tokens that you can
use to show when your models have acted – these are
available in a number of Kill Team products.

Distances in Kill Team are measured in inches (")
between the closest points of the bases of the models
you’re measuring to and from. An object (such as a
model) is said to be within a certain range (e.g. 6") of
something if the distance to that thing is that range or
less. So, for example, a model is within 6" of another
model as long as it is 6" or less from that model. If a
model does not have a base, measure to and from the
closest point of that model instead. You can measure
distances whenever you wish.

Most games of Kill Team are played on an area of 30"
by 22", which is the size of the gameboard included in
the boxed game. You can play games of Kill Team on a
playing surface of any size, though if it is any smaller
than 24" by 24" you may find it feels a bit cramped!

Kill Team uses six-sided dice, sometimes abbreviated to
D6. Some rules refer to 2D6, 3D6 and so on – in such
cases, roll that many D6s and add the results together.
If a rule requires you to roll a D3, roll a D6 and halve
the result. When halving any dice roll, round fractions
up before applying modifiers (if any) to the result.
All modifiers are cumulative. Some rules refer to an
‘unmodified roll’ – this means the result shown by the
dice, before any modifiers are applied.

If a rule requires a dice roll of, for example, 3 or more,
this is often abbreviated to 3+.

As billowing smoke rolls through the war-torn streets of Hive Magnius Delta, Skitarii and Genestealer Cults
kill teams engage in a savage firefight to seize control of vital supplies.

16



FIGHTING A BATTLE
Once you have your tools of war, you’ll need to choose
a mission to play. There is a mission included in these
core rules – Covert War (pg 41) – but there are others in
this book and available in other Kill Team products, and
you can even make up your missions. The mission you
play may have a bearing on which Citadel Miniatures
you use or how you set up the battlefield. For more
information about the different kinds of missions and
choosing one to play, see page 48.

KILL TEAMS, ENEMY MODELS
AND PLAYERS
The models that a player brings to a game of Kill Team
are collectively known as that player’s kill team. There
are rules for choosing which models are included in
your kill team – these are found on page 62. These rules
may be influenced by the mission you have chosen to
play. All models in the same kill team are referred to as
‘friendly models’, while all other models are referred to
as ‘enemy models’. All other players are referred to as
‘opponents’ or ‘enemy players’.

A player is said to be ‘controlling’ the models in their kill
team, and may be referred to as the ‘controlling player’
in the rules that follow.

WARHAMMER 40,000
In Warhammer 40,000, mighty armies clash across
spectacular tabletop battlefields. Where Kill Team
focuses on individual squads, the Warhammer
40,000 rulebook gives you all the rules you need to
fight battles between entire battalions of warriors,
war engines and heroes.

Each codex provides you with the background and
rules for one of the many factions in Warhammer
40,000. With this information, you can make your
kill team the foundation of an army!

RANDOM DETERMINATION
Some rules or abilities will ask you to randomly
determine something, usually a model from a kill
team. You may do this in a variety of ways, but the
simplest is to assign a number to each and roll a
number of D6 (or D10 – that is, ten-sided dice),
re-rolling any results not assigned to an eligible
model. For example, if you need to randomly select
a model from a kill team of 5, you would assign each
model a number from 1 to 5 and roll a D6, re-rolling
any results of 6. If the group you’re randomising is
larger than 10, simply split the group into 2 or more
smaller groups (of no more than 10), randomly
determine one of those groups and then randomly
determine the result within that group.

Datasheets and
Weapons

DATASHEETS AND WEAPONS
The characteristics of models are described on datasheets, which you will need in order to use them in
battle. This book includes all the datasheets you need to play Kill Team, and the details of the weapons
used on the battlefield. Here we explain the information found on datasheets and in weapon profiles.

1. Model Name
Here you’ll find the name of the model.

2. Profiles
These contain the following characteristics that tell you
how mighty models (and their variants) are:

Move (M): This is the speed at which a model moves
across the battlefield.

Weapon Skill (WS): This tells you a model’s skill at
hand-to-hand fighting. If a model has a Weapon Skill of
‘-’ it is unable to fight in melee and cannot make close
combat attacks at all.

Ballistic Skill (BS): This shows how accurate a model
is when shooting with ranged weapons. If a model has
a Ballistic Skill of ‘-’ it has no proficiency with ranged
weapons and cannot make shooting attacks at all.

Strength (S): This indicates how strong a model is
and how likely it is to inflict damage in hand-to-
hand combat.

Toughness (T): This reflects the model’s resilience
against physical harm.

Wounds (W): Wounds show how much damage a
model can sustain before it succumbs to its injuries.

Attacks (A): This tells you how many times a model can
strike blows in hand-to-hand combat.

Leadership (Ld): This reveals how courageous,
determined or self-controlled a model is.

Save (Sv): This indicates the protection a model’s
armour gives.

Maximum Number (Max): This number tells you how
many of this model you can include in a kill team.

3. Description
This tells you what the model is armed with. All
weapons have a profile described later in the same
section of the book as the datasheet. Some datasheets
have variant models with their own profiles, and where
this is the case they will be described here.

4. Wargear Options
Some models have the option to exchange the wargear
listed in their description for other options. Where that
is the case, the options will be listed here.

5. Abilities
Many models have exciting special abilities that are not
covered by the core rules: these will be described here.

6. Specialists
You can choose for some of the models in your kill team
to be specialists (pg 66). This section of a datasheet tells
you what kind of specialist each model can be.

7. Keywords
All datasheets have a list of keywords, sometimes
separated into Faction keywords and other keywords.
The former can be used as a guide to help decide which
models to include in your kill team, but otherwise both
sets of keywords are functionally the same. Sometimes a
rule will say that it applies to models that have a specific
keyword. For example, a rule might say that it applies to
‘all ADEPTUS ASTARTES models’. This means it would
only apply to models that have the Adeptus Astartes
keyword on their datasheet.

MODIFYING CHARACTERISTICS
You may encounter abilities and rules that modify a
characteristic. All modifiers are cumulative, though
you should apply any multiplication or division to the
characteristic (rounding fractions up) before applying
any addition or subtraction.

You may also encounter a characteristic that is a
random value instead of a number. For example, a
Move characteristic might be 2D6", or an Attacks
value might be D6. Roll to determine this value each
time the model uses that characteristic (e.g. when it
moves or makes attacks). Note that, regardless of the
source, characteristics of ‘-’ can never be modified,
and the Strength, Toughness and Leadership
characteristics of a model can never be modified
below 1.

18



Weapons
The weapons that the models in Kill Team use are
described using a set of characteristics as follows:

Range: How far the weapon can shoot. Weapons
with a Range of ‘Melee’ can only be used in hand-to-
hand combat. All other weapons are referred to as
ranged weapons.

Type: These are all explained under the Shooting and
Fight phases of the core rules.

Strength (S): How likely the weapon is to inflict
damage. If a weapon’s Strength lists ‘User’, it is equal
to the wielder’s current Strength. If a weapon lists a
modifier such as ‘+1’ or ‘x2’, you should modify the
user’s current Strength characteristic as shown to
determine the weapon’s Strength. For example, if a
weapon’s Strength was ‘x2’, and the user had a Strength
characteristic of 6, that weapon has Strength 12.

Armour Penetration (AP): How good it is at getting
through armour.

Damage (D): The amount of damage inflicted by a
successful hit.

Abilities: Some weapons have additional abilities that
change how they are used or what happens when they are
used. Where this is the case, it will be described here.

All of a model’s weapons are described later in this
book, in the appendix for that model’s Faction.

POINTS AND FORCE
Each model and each piece of wargear has a points
cost, as listed in each Faction’s section later in the
book. These points costs are used when choosing a
Battle-forged kill team (pg 62), and the total points
costs of all the models and wargear in your kill team
is known as its ‘Force’. A kill team’s Force gives a
value to a kill team that represents its strength, and
is used when players are choosing kill teams of equal
(or particular) strengths.

AURA ABILITIES
Some models have abilities that affect certain models
within a given range. Unless the ability in question
says otherwise, a model with a rule like this is always
within range of the effect. For example, an Acolyte
Hybrid with a cult icon gains the Cult Icon ability,
which allows re-rolls on hit rolls of 1 for friendly
models within 6". As the Acolyte Hybrid is always
within 6" of itself, it benefits from this ability as well.

The Battle
Round

Initiative Phase

Each Kill Team mission is played in a series of battle rounds. During each battle round, all players act in
an order determined in the Initiative phase. Each battle round consists of a series of phases, which must
be resolved in order.

The phases are as follows:

1. Initiative phase
The players roll off to determine
who will act first in each phase.

2. Movement phase
Players move any models that
are capable of doing so, and may
charge their enemies.

3. Psychic phase
Psykers can use powerful mental
abilities.

4. Shooting phase
Models may shoot at enemy
models.

5. Fight phase
Models pile in and attack with
melee weapons.

6. Morale phase
Players test to see if their kill team
is broken and if their models keep
their nerve.

Once these phases have been
played, the battle round has been
completed and the next one
begins, and so on, until the battle
is concluded.

THE BATTLE ROUND

1. INITIATIVE PHASE
Victory in war can be decided in a split second, a moment in which one side gains the upper hand.

In the Initiative phase, the players each roll 2D6. The
players’ results determine who has the first turn in each
phase in this battle round, with the highest scorer taking
the first turn, the next highest taking the second turn
and so on. The player with the first turn is referred to as
the player with the initiative. Any players who roll the
same result should roll their dice again to determine
which of them has a turn before the other(s). Once the
player order has been established, the Initiative phase
ends and the Movement phase begins.

RE-ROLLS
Some rules allow you to re-roll a dice roll, which
means you get to roll some or all of the dice again.
If a rule allows you to re-roll a result that was made
by adding several dice together (2D6, 3D6 etc.)
then, unless otherwise stated, you must roll all of
those dice again. You can never re-roll a dice more
than once, and re-rolls happen before modifiers
(if any) are applied.

ROLL-OFFS
Some rules instruct players to roll off. To do so, each
player rolls a D6 (or 2D6 if there are more than two
players), and whoever scores highest wins the
roll-off. In the case of a tie, those players re-roll their
dice – if the second and subsequent rolls are also
tied, keep on rolling until a winner is determined;
this is the only time players can re-roll a re-roll.

SEQUENCING
You’ll occasionally find that two or more rules are
to be resolved at the same time – normally ‘at the
start of the Movement phase’ or ‘before the battle
begins’. When this happens, the player who has the
initiative chooses the order. If these things occur
before or after the game, or before the player with
the initiative for the battle round is decided, the
players roll off and the winner decides in what
order the rules are resolved.

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PHASE…
Some rules or abilities refer to the beginning or end of a phase. Rules or abilities used at the beginning of the
phase are used before any player’s turn in that phase. Rules or abilities used at the end of the phase are used
after all players’ turns in that phase.

20



Movement
Phase2. MOVEMENT PHASE

Warriors move carefully towards their objective, advance quickly across the battlefield, or charge their
enemies even as their comrades prepare to unleash covering fire.

In the Movement phase, each player will take it in turn
to move all of the models in their kill team that they
wish to move, following the order determined in the
Initiative phase. Once a player has moved all of the
models they want to, the next player does the same,
and so on until all players have moved all of the models
they wish to move. Once all players have done so, the
Movement phase ends and the Psychic phase begins.

When it is your turn, pick a model from your kill team
and move it. You can then pick another model from
your kill team to move, until you have moved as many
of the models in your kill team as you wish. No model
can be moved more than once in each Movement phase
– if you have Kill Team tokens, place a token next to
each model you move as a reminder.

MOVING
You can change the position of a model on the
battlefield by making a move with the model. Models
can be moved in the Movement phase and the Fight
phase, and some abilities may allow a model to make a
move in other phases too.

Whenever you move a model, it can be moved in any
direction or combination of directions, but cannot
be moved across other models or their bases, nor can
it cross the edge of the battlefield. You can pivot the

model at the end of the move so that it is facing in any
direction. The distance a model moves is measured
using the part of the model’s base that moves furthest
from its starting position (including any pivots). If the
model has no base, measure the move using whichever
part of the model moves furthest from its starting
position. A model that only pivots is still considered to
have moved. A model must end its move on a surface it
can stand on (though see Wobbly Model Syndrome on
page 25).

MOVING OVER TERRAIN
Unless stated otherwise, a model can be moved over a
piece of terrain but not through it (so models cannot
move through a wall or a wreck, but can climb up or
over them). A model can be moved vertically in order
to climb or cross a piece of terrain, counting the vertical
distance up and/or down as part of its move.

FLY
If the datasheet for a model says it can FLY (i.e. it has the
FLY keyword), it can move across models and terrain –
other than impassable terrain (see page 42) – as if they
were not there, though it must end its move on a surface
it can stand on, other than another model or another
model’s base. Do not measure vertical distance when
moving a model that can FLY.

The Skitarii Ranger and Vanguard each have a Move characteristic of 6". Their player moves the Ranger 6" across the
battlefield, and the Vanguard 1.5" towards the wall, 4" up the wall, and 0.5" across the top of the ruin to its final position.

6"

1.5"

0.5"

21



NORMAL MOVE
Most moves made in the Movement phase are
called normal moves. A model making a normal
move can move a distance equal to or less than its
Move characteristic.

Enemy Models
When you make a normal move (or Advance, see right)
with a model, it may not be moved within 1" of any
enemy models. When you pick a model to move, if it is
within 1" of any enemy models, it cannot make a normal
move (or Advance).

FALLING BACK
When you pick a model to move, if that model started
the Movement phase within 1" of an enemy model,
it cannot make a normal move. Instead, it can either
remain stationary or Fall Back. A model cannot Fall
Back if an enemy model finished a charge move within
1" of it in the same phase. If you choose to Fall Back,
the model can move a distance equal to or less than its
Move characteristic, but must end its move more than
1" away from all enemy models. If a model Falls Back,
it cannot Advance, charge, React (see opposite) or be
Readied (see right) in that phase. A model that Falls
Back also cannot shoot later that battle round unless it

can FLY. If you have Kill Team tokens, place a Fall Back
token next to the model as a reminder.

ADVANCING
When you pick a model to move, instead of making a
normal move with that model you can declare that it
will Advance, unless it is within 1" of an enemy model.
If you do so, make an Advance roll by rolling a D6.
Add the result to the model’s Move characteristic for
that Movement phase. You can then move that model a
distance equal to or less than its Move characteristic. A
model that Advances cannot charge, React or shoot later
that battle round. If you have Kill Team tokens, place an
Advance token next to the model as a reminder.

READYING
When you pick a model to move, instead of making a
normal move (including pivoting the model) you can
Ready them, unless they are within 1" of an enemy
model. A model that is Readied in the Movement phase
has an advantage in the subsequent Shooting phase,
as described on page 28. If you have Kill Team tokens,
place a Ready token next to the model as a reminder. If
the model moves for any reason, it is no longer Readied
– remove this token.

The Skitarii player chooses to Fall Back with the Skitarii Vanguard. They move the model so it is more than 1" from the
Neophyte Hybrid. The Skitarii player Advances with the Vanguard Alpha. They roll a 4, so – adding this result to the
Vanguard Alpha’s Move characteristic of 6" – may move it up to 10".

22



CHARGING
When you pick a model to move, if it is not within
1" of an enemy model and is within 12" of an enemy
model, instead of making a normal move you can
declare that it will attempt to charge. Follow the charge
sequence below.

1. Choose Target(s)
Choose one or more enemy models within 12" of the
charging model as the target(s) of the charge.

2. React
After you have declared a charge, any opponents take
it in turn to make Reactions with any models from
their kill teams that are allowed to do so, if they wish to
do so, in the order determined in the Initiative phase.
Once one opponent has resolved all of their models’
Reactions, the next player can do so, and so on.

A model can React if it is the target of a charging model
and it is more than 1" from an enemy model. A model
can either fire Overwatch or Retreat when it Reacts.
If, at any point, the charging model is slain, no further
Reactions can be made for this charge sequence.

Overwatch
Overwatch is a special type of shooting attack that is
described on page 31. A target model can potentially fire
Overwatch several times in a battle round.

Retreat
A target model cannot Retreat if it has already made a
move of any kind (or attempted to charge) in this phase.
A model can Retreat if it has already fired Overwatch in
this phase. When a model Retreats, it can be moved up
to 3" by the controlling player. This move must end with
the model further away from the charging model, and
more than 1" from any other enemy models. A model
that Retreats cannot React later in the battle round,
and cannot shoot later in the battle round (unless it can
FLY). If you have Kill Team tokens, place a Fall Back
token next to the model as a reminder.

The Genestealer Cults player declares that the Neophyte Hybrid will charge both Skitarii Vanguard. The Skitarii player
chooses for one of their Vanguard to Retreat as a Reaction to the charge, and moves their model 3" away. They then
declare that their other Vanguard will fire Overwatch, and resolve that attack before the charge move is made.

CHARGE SEQUENCE
1. Choose target(s)
2. Enemy Reacts
3. Roll 2D6 and make charge move

23



3. Make Charge Move
After all Reactions have been resolved, make a charge
roll by rolling 2D6. The charging model can move up to
this number of inches – this is their charge distance this
turn. To make a successful charge roll, the model must
finish its move within 1" of at least one of the target
models. A model that does so is said to have charged,
and the enemy models that are within 1" of it at the
end of its move are said to have been charged. It cannot
move within 1" of an enemy model that was not a target
of its charge.

If the model cannot finish its move while following these
restrictions, the charge fails and the model is not said to
have charged – however, the model can move up to its
charge distance, as long as that move takes it as close as
possible to at least one of the targets of its charge, and
not within 1" of any enemy models. A model can only
make one charge attempt in each Movement phase, and
once it has done so it cannot shoot later in the battle
round. If you have Kill Team tokens, place a Charge
token next to the model as a reminder.

The charge roll of 8 gives the Neophyte Hybrid a charge distance of 8". It is able to move to within 1" of one of its targets
with this distance, so the Neophyte Hybrid is moved to within 1" of that model. If the player had not rolled high enough
for the Neophyte Hybrid to reach any of its targets, the charge would have failed.

24



WOBBLY MODEL SYNDROME
Sometimes you may find that a particular piece of
terrain makes it hard to put a model exactly where
you want. If you delicately balance it in place, it is
very likely to fall as soon as somebody nudges the
table, leaving your model damaged or even broken.
In cases like this, we find it is perfectly acceptable
to leave the model in a safer position, as long as all
players have agreed and know its ‘actual’ location.
If, later on, an opponent is considering shooting
the model, you will have to hold it back in the
proper place so they can check if it is visible.

REINFORCEMENTS
Some models have the ability to be set up on the
battlefield mid-battle round, sometimes by using
teleporters, grav-chutes or other, more esoteric
means. Typically, this happens at the end of the
Movement phase, but it can also happen during
other phases. Models that are set up in this manner
cannot move further, Advance or charge during
the battle round they arrive, though they can
otherwise act normally (use psychic powers, shoot,
etc.) for the rest of the battle round. Models that
arrive as reinforcements count as having made
a normal move for all rules purposes, such as
shooting Heavy weapons (pg 29). Any model that
has not arrived on the battlefield by the end of the
battle counts as having been taken out of action
(pg 32).

THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE
In a game as detailed and wide-ranging as Kill
Team, there may be times when you are not sure
exactly how to resolve a situation that has come up
during play. When this happens, have a quick chat
with your opponent(s) and apply the solution that
makes the most sense to you (or seems the most
fun!). If no single solution presents itself, you and
your opponent(s) should roll off, and whoever rolls
highest gets to choose what happens. Then you can
get on with the game!

Psychic Phase
3. PSYCHIC PHASE
Warrior mystics and sorcerers wield the strange power of the warp to aid their allies and destroy their
foes. Harnessing this force is not without risk, however, and with the smallest mistake, there can be
horrendous consequences.

Some models are noted as being a PSYKER on their
datasheet. Psykers can manifest their otherworldly
abilities and attempt to deny enemy sorceries. In the
Psychic phase, players take it in turn to choose a single
psyker from their kill team with which to attempt to
manifest one or more psychic powers, in the order
determined in the Initiative phase. Each player can only
choose a single psyker in each battle round, and once all
players with any psykers have done so (or have decided
not to), the Psychic phase ends and the Shooting phase
begins. Each attempt to manifest a psychic power uses
the following sequence.

1. Choose Power
First, declare the power that the psyker you have chosen
will attempt to manifest. The powers a psyker knows,
and the number of powers they can attempt to manifest
or deny in each Psychic phase, are detailed on their
datasheet. A psyker cannot attempt to manifest the same
psychic power more than once in a battle round.

Psychic Powers
Unless stated otherwise, all psykers know the Psybolt
psychic power, detailed below. Some know other
powers instead of, or in addition to, Psybolt – the
model’s datasheets and other supplementary rules you
are using will make it clear which powers each psyker
knows. If a psyker generates their powers before the
battle, do so immediately before any players begin to
deploy their kill team.

2. Take Psychic Test
You can attempt to manifest a psychic power with a
psyker from your kill team by taking a Psychic test.
To do so, roll 2D6. If the total is equal to or greater
than that power’s warp charge value, the power is
successfully manifested.

‘The warp. It is known by many names: the
sea of souls, the empyrean, the immaterium…
It is a realm of boundless energy that can
both empower and destroy. It is the domain
of Daemons, the predatory entities that
serve the dreaded Chaos Gods, and that will
greedily devour the soul of any living thing
should they be given the chance.

It is from the warp that those with psychic
abilities draw their power, to hurl crackling
arcs of lethal energies at their enemies, to
shield their comrades from harm, or to scry
the skeins of the future. Such witchery may
be undone using the very same forces that
gave rise to it, or, more rarely, the source of a
psychic null field.

Yet all must beware when the veil is
pierced, for the minds of psykers burn like
beacons in the warp. The deeper they draw
from the well, the greater and more terrible
are the malign entities that may be attracted
to their mind-spoor.

At such times must the whispers of
Daemons be resisted with the greatest
fervour! All it takes is a single moment of
weakness to invite damnation and death
upon all.’

- Extract from Grimenghael’s Treatise on the
Perils of the Immaterium

Psybolt
Psybolt has a warp charge value of 5. If manifested,
the closest enemy model within 18" of and visible
to the psyker suffers 1 mortal wound (pg 33). If the
result of the Psychic test was 11+, the target suffers
D3 mortal wounds instead.

Perils of the Warp
If you roll a double 1 or a double 6 when taking
a Psychic test, the psyker immediately suffers
Perils of the Warp. The psyker suffers D3 mortal
wounds (pg 33). If the psyker is taken out of
action (pg 32) by Perils of the Warp, the power
they were attempting to manifest automatically
fails and each model within 3" immediately
suffers D3 mortal wounds.

PSYCHIC SEQUENCE
1. Choose power
2. Take Psychic test
3. Enemy takes Deny the Witch test
4. Resolve psychic power

26



3. Deny the Witch Tests
If there are any enemy psykers within 24" of a psyker
that has manifested a psychic power, the controlling
player can choose one of those models to take a Deny
the Witch test to resist the psychic power. The number
of times a psyker can make a Deny the Witch attempt
in each battle round is specified on their datasheet.
Only one model can take a Deny the Witch test for
each psychic power that is manifested, regardless of the
number of models that could make an attempt or the
number of times each is allowed to try and Deny the
Witch in each battle round.

If more than one player has an eligible model to take a
Deny the Witch test, players take it in turn to choose a
model from their kill team to take a Deny the Witch test
with, or pass, in the order determined in the Initiative
phase. If a player passes, it is the next player’s turn to
choose, and so on until a player chooses a model to take
a Deny the Witch test or all players with eligible models
have passed.

To take a Deny the Witch test, roll 2D6. If the total is
greater than the result of the Psychic test that manifested
the power, it has been successfully resisted and its effects
are negated.

4. Resolve Psychic Power
So long as the Psychic test was successful, the psyker
was not taken out of action as a result of Perils of the
Warp, and the attempt was not successfully resisted by
a Deny the Witch test, then the controlling player may
resolve the effect of the psychic power, which will be
described in the power itself.

If the psyker can attempt to manifest more than one
psychic power in each battle round, the controlling
player may then attempt to manifest another psychic
power with them, following the same sequence, until
they cannot make any more attempts or do not wish to
make any further attempts.

27



Shooting Phase
4. SHOOTING PHASE
Gun muzzles flare, shots ring out, and grenades crack as sentries are eliminated; lone operatives are
picked off, or multiple combatants are mown down in sudden crossfires.

In the Shooting phase, players take it in turn to choose a
model from their kill team to shoot with. The Shooting
phase is split into two sections: in the first section
Readied models shoot, and in the second section other
models shoot. No model can be chosen to shoot more
than once in a Shooting phase – if you have Kill Team
tokens, place a Shoot token next to each model which
shoots as a reminder.

READY, FIRE!
Readied models shoot before all other models. Players
take it in turn to choose a Readied model from their kill
team to shoot with (following the sequence below), or
pass, in the order determined in the Initiative phase. If a
player passes, it is the next player’s turn to choose. Once
all players have done so, they do so again in the same
order, until all players pass in succession. When all of
the players pass in succession, the Ready, Fire! section of
the Shooting phase is over.

FIRE AT WILL
Once the Ready, Fire! section of the Shooting phase is
over, players take it in turn to choose a model from their
kill team to shoot with, or pass, in the order determined
in the Initiative phase. If a player passes, it is the next
player’s turn to choose. Once all players have done so,
they do so again in the same order, until all players pass
in succession. When all of the players pass in succession,
the Shooting phase is over and the Fight phase begins.

Each shooting attack uses the following sequence:

1. Choose Model to Shoot With
When it is your turn, choose a model from your kill
team to shoot with. You may not choose a model that
has made a charge attempt, Advanced, Fallen Back
(unless it can FLY) or Retreated this battle round, or
a model that is within 1" of an enemy model. Unless
otherwise stated, the model attacks with all of the
ranged weapons it is armed with, one after the other.

2. Choose Ranged Weapon and Targets
Having chosen a shooting model, you must pick the
ranged weapon it will use and the target model (or
models, see opposite) for the attacks. The weapons a
model has are listed on its datasheet.

Range and Visibility
In order for a shooting model to target an enemy
model, the enemy model must be within the Range of
the weapon being used (as listed on its profile) and be
visible to the shooting model. If unsure, stoop down and
get a look from behind the shooting model to see if any
part of the target is visible from any part of the shooting
model. Models cannot target enemy models that are
within 1" of friendly models – the risk of hitting your
own troops is too great.

Number of Attacks
Each time a model shoots a ranged weapon, it will make
a number of attacks. You roll one dice for each attack
being made. The number of attacks a model can make
with a weapon, and therefore the number of dice you
can roll, is found on the weapon’s profile, along with the
weapon’s type. A weapon’s type can impact the number
of attacks it can make (see opposite).

FAST DICE ROLLING
The rules for resolving attacks (pg 30-32) have been
written assuming you will make them one at a time.
However, it is possible to speed up your battles by rolling
the dice for similar attacks together. In order to make
several attacks at once, all of the attacks must have
the same Ballistic Skill (if it’s a shooting attack) or the
same Weapon Skill (if it’s a close combat attack) and
be subject to the same modifiers. They must also have
the same Strength, Armour Penetration and Damage
characteristics, and they must be directed at the same
model. If this is the case, make all of the hit rolls at the
same time, then all of the wound rolls. Your opponent
can then make the saving throws one at a time and
suffer damage each time as appropriate.

SHOOTING SEQUENCE
1. Choose model to shoot with
2. Choose ranged weapon and targets
3. Resolve attacks

• Make hit roll
• Make wound roll
• Enemy makes saving throw
• Inflict damage

4. Choose another ranged weapon
and targets

28



Targets
If a weapon makes more than one attack, you can
choose for the shooting model to make all of them
against the same target, or to split them. If you choose
to split its attacks, you must split them between an
initial target model, chosen as described above, and any
number of enemy models within 2" of that target that
are also eligible targets. After determining the number
of shots made (if necessary, see right), declare how you
will split the shooting model’s shots before making any
hit rolls, and resolve all the shots against one target
before moving on to the next.

For example, a Skitarii Vanguard is firing his radium
carbine (an Assault 3 weapon, which means it fires three
shots). He has two eligible targets, and they are within
2" of one another, so the controlling player decides that
the Skitarii Vanguard will split his attacks. The player
will make two attacks against one of the targets, and one
attack against the other.

Weapon Types
There are five types of ranged weapon: Assault, Heavy,
Rapid Fire, Grenade and Pistol. A model shooting one
of these weapons can make a number of attacks equal
to the number written on its profile after its type. For
example, a model firing an ‘Assault 1’ weapon can make
1 attack with that weapon; a model firing a ‘Heavy 3’
weapon can make 3 attacks, etc.

Some weapons make a random number of attacks
– D3 or D6, for example. Once a player has rolled
to determine how many shots a weapon of this kind
makes, they can choose a target or targets as normal.

Each type of ranged weapon also has an additional rule
that, depending upon the situation, might affect the
accuracy of the weapon or when it can be fired. These
are as follows:

ASSAULT
Assault weapons fire so rapidly or indiscriminately
that they can be shot from the hip as warriors dash
forwards into combat.

You can choose to shoot with a model with an Assault
weapon in the Shooting phase (or React with that
model to fire Overwatch) even if it Advanced earlier in
that battle round. If it does so, it can only fire Assault
weapons, and you must subtract 1 from any hit rolls
made when firing that weapon this battle round.

HEAVY
Heavy weapons are the biggest and deadliest guns on
the battlefield, but require reloading, careful set-up or
bracing to fire at full effect.

If a model with a Heavy weapon moved in the preceding
Movement phase, you must subtract 1 from any hit rolls
made when firing that weapon this battle round.

Skitarii arc pistol Genestealer Cult autopistol Skitarii radium pistol

This Genestealer Cult grenade launcher is an Assault
weapon with multiple ammunition types.

Skitarii arc rifles are Rapid Fire weapons, which means
they make more shots at targets within half range.

A Skitarii transuranic arquebus is a Heavy weapon
that does not suffer the normal penalty for firing at
long range.

29



RAPID FIRE
Rapid Fire weapons are capable of single aimed shots
at long range and controlled bursts at close quarters.

A model firing a Rapid Fire weapon doubles the number
of attacks it makes if all of its targets are within half the
weapon’s Range characteristic.

GRENADE
Grenades are handheld explosive devices that a
warrior throws at the enemy while their squad mates
provide covering fire.

A model in your kill team armed with a Grenade
weapon may fire it in Overwatch or in the Shooting
phase. If they do so, they cannot fire any other weapons
that phase, and no other model in your kill team can fire
a Grenade weapon that phase.

PISTOL
Pistols are carried one-handed and can even be used
in a melee to shoot at point-blank range.

You can choose to shoot with a model with a Pistol
weapon even if there are enemy models within 1", but
it must target the closest enemy model (you can choose
which if two or more are equidistant) and can only
shoot with its Pistol weapon(s). In such circumstances,
the model can shoot its Pistol even if other friendly
models are within 1" of the same enemy model. It
cannot fire a Pistol if it was charged in this battle round.

Each time a model armed with both a Pistol and another
type of ranged weapon (e.g. a Pistol and a Rapid Fire
weapon) is chosen to shoot, it can either shoot with its
Pistol(s) or with all of its other weapons. Choose which
it will fire (Pistols or non-Pistols) before making hit rolls.

3. Resolve Attacks
Attacks can be made one at a time, or, in some cases,
you can roll for multiple attacks together. The following
sequence is used to make attacks one at a time:

1. Hit Roll: To see if an attack hits the target, roll a D6
and apply the following cumulative modifiers:

If the result is equal to or greater than the attacking
model’s Ballistic Skill characteristic, then it scores a hit
with the weapon it is using. If not, the attack fails and
the attack sequence ends. An unmodified hit roll of 1
always fails, and an unmodified hit roll of 6 always hits.

This model is completely visible and so is not considered
to be obscured.

This model’s leg is hidden behind the wall; it is therefore
considered to be obscured. In addition, it is standing
within 1" of the ruin that obscures it – this means it will be
more difficult to injure (pg 32).

HIT ROLL MODIFIERS
Target model is at long range (see opposite) -1
Target model is obscured (see right) -1
Each flesh wound on the attacking model (pg 32) -1
Attacking model’s kill team is broken (pg 36) -1

Obscured
Other models (even friendly models) and terrain
may hide a target from view. If the target of an
attack is even partially obscured from the best
point of view of the firing model (that is, the
point of view from a part of the firing model that
gives the clearest line of sight), then it is said to be
obscured.

When checking to see if a target is obscured,
consider the main body of the firing and target
models – do not include a model’s base or parts
that are ‘sticking out’ like aerials or weapons, but
do include all limbs and a model’s head. If there is
still doubt, we recommend the players agree about
what constitutes the main body of a model before
the battle begins.

30



Overwatch
Overwatch is a special type of shooting attack,
made by a model that is the target of a charge and
resolved in the Movement phase. It uses all the
normal rules for shooting (e.g. the target must
be in range and visible when they declare the
charge), except that any attacks made must target
the model attempting to charge, and a 6 is always
required for a successful hit roll, irrespective of the
firing model’s Ballistic Skill or any modifiers.

Long Range
A target is at long range if it is more than half
the weapon’s Range characteristic away from the
attacking model. Grenade weapons are not affected
by this rule.

For example, a boltgun has a Range of 24". Any
target that is more than 12" away from a model
attacking with a boltgun is at long range.

the Toughness?

2. Wound Roll: If an attack scores a hit, you will
then need to roll another dice to see if the
attack wounds the target. The roll required is
determined by comparing the attacking weapon’s
Strength characteristic with the target’s Toughness
characteristic, as shown on the following table:

If the roll is equal to or greater than the required
number, the attack succeeds and the attack sequence
continues. If the roll is less than the required number,
the attack fails and the attack sequence ends. An
unmodified wound roll of 1 always fails and an
unmodified wound roll of 6 is always successful.

3. Saving Throw: The player controlling the target
model then makes a saving throw by rolling a D6
and modifying the roll by the Armour Penetration
characteristic of the attacking weapon. For example,
if the attacking weapon has an Armour Penetration
of -1, then 1 is subtracted from the saving throw.
If the result is equal to, or greater than, the Save
characteristic of the target model, then the damage is
prevented and the attack sequence ends. If the result
is less than the model’s Save characteristic, then the
saving throw fails and the model suffers damage. An
unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails.

4. Inflict Damage: The damage inflicted is equal to
the Damage characteristic of the weapon used in the
attack. A model loses one wound for each point of
damage it suffers. If a model’s wounds are reduced
to 0, any further attacks directed against this model
by the attacking weapon are not resolved, and then
the player controlling the attacking model makes an
Injury roll for the target model (see overleaf).

31



Injury Roll
When a model’s wounds are reduced to 0, the controlling
player (unless stated otherwise, e.g. Inflict Damage on
page 31) makes an Injury roll for that model. To make an
Injury roll, the player rolls a D6 and applies the following
modifiers, depending on how the damage was caused:

They then look up the result on the following table:

Flesh Wound
A model that suffers a flesh wound is restored to 1
wound remaining. A model with one or more flesh
wounds suffers penalties to hit (pg 30) and is more likely
to be taken out of action (see above). Mark one of the
empty Flesh Wound boxes on that model’s datacard (pg
63). If a model suffers a flesh wound and all of the Flesh
Wound boxes on their datacard are marked, it is taken
out of action instead (see right). In the Morale phase each
player takes Nerve tests for each of their models that has
one or more flesh wounds (pg 36).

Out of Action
A model that is taken out of action is seriously injured
or may even be slain – either way it will play no
further part in the battle. Remove that model from the
battlefield.

Damage Characteristic
If a model loses its last wound to an attack that has a
Damage characteristic of more than 1, the player whose
model made the attack rolls a number of dice equal to
that characteristic when making the Injury roll, rather
than just one, and applies the highest result (after
modifiers). If the attack has a Damage characteristic
that is a random value (e.g. D3, D6), use the value rolled
when inflicting damage.

For example, if a model with 3 wounds remaining
fails its saving throw against a weapon with a Damage
characteristic of 3, it will be reduced to 0 wounds and
the player controlling the attacking model will roll three
dice for the Injury roll, applying the highest result.

If a model loses its last wound when there are attacks or
mortal wounds (see opposite) still allocated to it, these
are not resolved.

4. Choose Another Ranged Weapon
and Targets
If the attacking model has any other ranged weapons
that it can fire, and you wish it to do so, return to step
2 of the shooting sequence (pg 28). Otherwise, the
shooting sequence ends.

PSYCHIC POWER/SHOOTING ATTACK INJURY

Each flesh wound on the injured model +1

CLOSE COMBAT ATTACK INJURY ROLL MODIFIER

Each flesh wound on the injured model +1

D6 RESULT

3 or less Flesh wound

4+ Out of action

32



Invulnerable Saves
Some models possess abilities or wargear, such
as supernatural reflexes or force fields, that grant
them an invulnerable save. Each time you are
required to make a save roll for a model with an
invulnerable save, you can choose to use either its
normal Save characteristic or its invulnerable save,
but not both. If you use a model’s invulnerable
save, it is never modified by a weapon’s Armour
Penetration value. If a model has more than one
invulnerable save, it can only use one of them –
choose which it will use.

Mortal Wounds
Some attacks inflict mortal wounds – these are
so powerful that no armour or force field can
withstand their fury. Each mortal wound inflicts one
point of damage on the target model. Do not make a
wound roll or saving throw (including invulnerable
saves) against a mortal wound – just inflict damage
to the model as described on page 31. If a mortal
wound reduces a model to 0 wounds, any further
mortal wounds directed against this model by this
attack are not resolved and the player whose model
caused the mortal wound makes an Injury roll for
that model (see opposite).

33



Fight Phase
5. FIGHT PHASE
Warriors are silenced with a knife to the back, or cut down as their positions are overrun.

In the Fight phase, players take it in turn to choose
a model from their kill team to fight with. The Fight
phase is split into two sections: in the first section
charging models fight, and in the second section other
models fight. No model can be chosen to fight more
than once in a Fight phase.

HAMMER OF WRATH
Models that charged in this battle round fight before all
other models. Players take it in turn to choose a model
that charged from their kill team to fight with (see
below), or pass, in the order determined in the Initiative
phase. If a player passes, it is the next player’s turn to
choose. A player cannot choose to pass if they have a
model that charged that can fight. Once all players have
chosen a model from their kill team or passed, they
do so again in the same order, until all players pass in
succession. When they do so, the Hammer of Wrath
section of the Fight phase is over.

FIGHT FOR YOUR LIVES
Once the Hammer of Wrath section of the Fight
phase is over, players take it in turn to choose a model
from their kill team to fight with, or pass, in the order
determined in the Initiative phase. If a player passes,
it is the next player’s turn to choose. A player cannot
choose to pass if they have a model that can fight. Once
all players have chosen a model from their kill team
or passed, they do so again in the same order, until all
players pass in succession. When they do so, the Fight
phase is over and the Morale phase begins.

Models that can Fight
Any model that charged or was charged in this battle
round, or that is within 1" of an enemy model, can be
chosen to fight in the Fight phase.

Each time a model fights, use the following sequence:

1. Pile In
You may move the model up to 3" – the model must end
the move closer to the nearest enemy model.

2. Choose Targets
First, you must pick the target model, or models, for
the attacks. To target an enemy model, the attacking
model must be within 1" of that model, and the enemy
model must be visible to the attacking model. Models
that charged this battle round can only target enemy
models that they charged or that charged them earlier in
the battle round. If there are no valid targets, this fight
sequence ends.

If a model can make more than one close combat attack
(see below), it can split them between eligible target
models as you wish. Declare how you will split the
model’s close combat attacks before any dice are rolled,
and resolve all attacks against one target before moving
on to the next.

Number of Attacks   
The number of close combat attacks a model makes
against its target is determined by its Attacks
characteristic. You roll one dice for each close combat
attack being made. For example, if a model has an
Attacks characteristic of 2, it can make 2 close combat
attacks and you can therefore roll 2 dice.

3. Choose Melee Weapon
Each time a model makes a close combat attack, it uses a
melee weapon – the weapons a model is armed with are
listed on its datasheet. In addition to the melee weapons
listed on their datasheets, all models are also assumed to
be able to fight with a close combat weapon, which has
the following profile:

WEAPON RANGE TYPE S AP D
Close combat weapon Melee Melee User 0 1

If a model has more than one melee weapon, choose
which it will use before rolling the dice. If a model has
more than one melee weapon and can make several
close combat attacks, it can split its attacks between
these weapons however you wish – declare how you will
divide the attacks before any dice are rolled.

FIGHT SEQUENCE
1. Pile in up to 3"
2. Choose targets
3. Choose melee weapon
4. Resolve close combat attacks

• Make hit roll
• Make wound roll
• Enemy makes saving throw
• Inflict damage

5. Consolidate up to 3"

34



4. Resolve Close Combat Attacks
Close combat attacks can be made one at a time, or
in some cases you can roll the dice for a number of
attacks together. The attack sequence for making close
combat attacks is identical to that used for shooting
attacks (pg 30) except you use the model’s Weapon Skill
characteristic instead of its Ballistic Skill to make hit
rolls, and apply the following cumulative modifiers to
your hit rolls:

5. Consolidate
You may move the model up to 3" – the model must end
the move closer to the nearest enemy model.

All of these models would suffer a -1 hit penalty in the Fight phase because their targets are behind intervening terrain.
Either player could, however, use a model’s pile-in move to get around the intervening terrain if they wished.

Intervening Terrain
There is said to be intervening terrain between an
attacking model and its target if there is any terrain
between the models that makes it impossible for
the models to be placed in contact with each other.

HIT ROLL MODIFIERS
There is intervening terrain (see right) -1

Each flesh wound on the attacking model -1

Attacking model’s kill team is broken (pg 36) -1

35



Morale Phase
6. MORALE PHASE
The bravest heart may quail when the horrors of battle take their toll, but some fighters will rally even in
the greatest adversity.

In the Morale phase, players take it in turn to
play through the following sequence, in the order
determined in the Initiative phase:

Once the first player has played through this sequence,
the next player does so, and so on until all players have
done so. Once they have done so, the Morale phase and
the battle round are over. The players remove any tokens
from their models (other than Shaken tokens, see right),
and then the next battle round begins.

1. Check If Your Kill Team Is Broken
If all models in a kill team currently have flesh
wounds, are shaken or are out of action, it is broken.
Otherwise, if more than half of the models in your kill
team currently have flesh wounds, are shaken or are
out of action, it may be broken. Roll 2D6 – if the total
is greater than the highest Leadership characteristic
of any of the models in the kill team (other than
those that are shaken or out of action), the kill team is
broken. Once a kill team is broken, it stays broken for
the rest of the game.

Models in a broken kill team need to take Nerve
tests in each Morale phase. In addition, they suffer
hit penalties as described in the Shooting and Fight
phases, and there are additional penalties for broken
kill teams in some missions.

2. Remove Shaken tokens
If you have any shaken models, they are now no longer
shaken. Remove the Shaken token from each of these
models.

3. Take Nerve Tests
You must take a Nerve test for each of your models that
has a flesh wound, and for your other models if your kill
team is broken. To take a Nerve test for a model, roll a
D6 and apply the following cumulative modifiers:

If the result of the Nerve test exceeds the model’s
Leadership characteristic, the test is failed. The model
is shaken, and cannot do anything until it is no longer
shaken: place a Shaken token next to it. Otherwise,
the test is passed. The test is always passed on an
unmodified roll of 1.

MORALE SEQUENCE
1. Check if your kill team is broken
2. Remove Shaken tokens
3. Take Nerve tests

NERVE TEST MODIFIERS
Each other friendly model that is shaken or is out
of action +1

Each other friendly model (other than shaken
models) within 2" of the model -1

Example Battle Round

EXAMPLE BATTLE ROUND
These pages take you through an example battle round in a mission played by two players, Adam and Beth, showing you the sequence of the
phases and the decisions and actions each player might make.

1. INITIATIVE PHASE
In the Initiative phase, the Adeptus
Mechanicus player (Adam) and the
Genestealer Cults player (Beth) roll off. Adam
wins, rolling higher than Beth, so he has the
initiative for this battle round.

3. SHOOTING PHASE
Both players have a Readied model. These
will shoot before any other models do so,
but Adam gets to act with his Readied model
first as he has the initiative. His Readied
Ranger cannot target the Neophyte Leader,
as the Neophyte Leader is within 1" of
another friendly model. Instead, the Ranger
shoots at the Neophyte Heavy. Adam checks
what his Ranger can see, and sees that the
Neophyte Heavy is obscured – he will have
to subtract 1 from its hit rolls. He rolls two
dice, and with his Ranger’s BS of 3+ he needs
to roll 4 or more for a hit (because of the
modifier). He scores a hit! He then checks
the weapon’s Strength – 4 – against his
target’s Toughness – 3. This means he needs
to roll 3+ for a successful wound. He rolls a
2, so Adam fails to wound his target and the
attack sequence ends.

4. FIGHT PHASE
It’s now the Fight phase. Although Adam has the initiative, Beth has a
model that charged (and Adam doesn't), so she gets to choose that model
to act first in this phase. First she piles in with her model, moving it closer
to her target. Her Leader has an Attacks characteristic of 2, so she rolls 2
dice, looking for rolls of 4+ to hit. Both of her attacks miss.

It’s now time for models that didn’t charge to fight, and there’s only one –
the Ranger who was charged. Adam cannot pile in with this model – it’s
already as close as it can get to its target – so he simply attacks, rolling
1 dice and hoping for a 4+. He succeeds, and goes on to roll a 5 – more
than enough to wound his target. Beth then makes a saving throw for her
Leader, needing a 5+, and rolls a 3. Her Neophyte Leader is Injured, and
Adam makes an Injury roll. Luckily for Beth, he only rolls a 1, and her
Leader simply suffers a flesh wound, which she notes on its datacard.

2. MOVEMENT PHASE
In the Movement phase, Adam moves his kill
team first, as he has the initiative. He makes
a normal move with one of his Rangers
(1), looking for a good clear view of the
battlefield. His other Ranger (2) already has a
good view, so he Readies that model instead.
Finally, Adam Advances with his Vanguard
(3) – he rolls a dice, scoring 1, and adds that
to the Vanguard’s Move characteristic for
this phase, meaning it can move 7" (Adam
hopes to use its Assault weapon in the
Shooting phase).

7"

ADVANCE!

HIT!

NO WOUND



5. MORALE PHASE
There are no other models that can Fight, so with that phase over it’s time
for the Morale phase. Beginning with Adam, the two players check if their
kill teams are broken (they do not need to test, as neither player has more
than half of their models with flesh wounds, shaken or out of action) and
then take Nerve tests for their models with flesh wounds (Adam rolls for
his Vanguard and gets a 4 – it’s not shaken, and Beth rolls for her Neophyte
Leader, getting a 1 – it’s also not shaken).

It's then the end of this battle round and time for the next one.

It’s now Beth’s turn to shoot with a
Readied model – her Neophyte Heavy.
The Vanguard is a prime target – it’s in the
open, and Beth won’t have any penalties to
her hit rolls. She rolls 4 dice for the Heavy’s
seismic cannon, and scores 2 hits. The
Strength of the weapon is the same as the
target’s Toughness – 3 – so Beth needs to
roll 4+ to wound her target. She does, and
with both hits! Adam then rolls his model’s
saving throws, hoping for some good luck.
The weapon has no AP, so Adam is looking
for rolls of 4+. He rolls one 4, so that shot
does no damage, but he also rolls a 1 – that
one goes through! His Vanguard loses a
wound, which takes it to 0 wounds. Beth
then makes an Injury roll for the Vanguard.
With a roll of 3, the Vanguard suffers a
flesh wound – Adam makes a note of this
on its datacard.

It is now Beth’s turn to move her models.
Her Neophyte Heavy (4) is well placed,
so she Readies it. Then she chooses her
Neophyte Leader (5) and declares a charge
against the Ranger who moved! Adam gets a
chance to React: the Ranger cannot Retreat,
as it has already moved, so he declares it will
fire Overwatch instead. He rolls 2 dice for its
galvanic rifle – a Rapid Fire 1 weapon – as
the target is within half range of the weapon.
He's looking for rolls of 6 to hit, as is always
the case when firing Overwatch. Both of his
shots miss!

Then the Neophyte Leader charges. Beth rolls
2 dice and adds them together, getting 9 – this
is how far she can move the Leader (enough to
reach its target), and she does so, bringing it to
within 1" of its target.

There are no psykers on the battlefield, so the
players skip the Psychic phase and move on to
the Shooting phase.

Fighting a
Battle

FIGHTING A BATTLE
In games of Kill Team, your hand-picked fighters will be tasked with a specific objective, whether this is to
infiltrate enemy territory, sabotage critical resources or disrupt supply lines.

THE MISSION
Before you can fight a battle in a game of Kill Team,
you must select a mission. The core rules include the
Covert War mission (see opposite) which is ideal to
get the action started quickly. Others can be found
elsewhere in this book, in other books, or you could
play a mission of your own creation. If you and your
opponent(s) cannot agree on which mission to play, the
players should roll off, and whoever wins decides on the
mission. Alternatively, if you are playing a campaign, the
campaign rules (pg 202-205) explain how to determine
which mission you will play.

THE KILL TEAMS
Once you have chosen which mission to play, you must
choose your kill team. For the Covert War mission you
can include any miniatures from your collection, but the
full rules for choosing a kill team can be found on page
62. The mission you are playing may include additional
rules that change how you choose your kill team.

THE BATTLEFIELD
In the far future, battles are fought across an infinite
variety of strange and alien planets where no land is left
untouched by the blight of war. Crystal moons, derelict
space hulks and nightmarish Daemon worlds are just a
few of the fantastical landscapes that can be recreated
whenever you play a game of Kill Team.

Once you have chosen your mission and your kill teams,
you must set up the battlefield. A battlefield can be any
surface upon which the models can stand – a dining
table, for example, or the floor. We typically assume a
battlefield is 30" by 22" – the same size as a Kill Team
gameboard – though some missions will state other
dimensions. The battlefield should always be large
enough to accommodate all your models – if it is not,
simply increase the size of the battlefield. If you are
playing a game with three or four players you may wish

to increase the size of the battlefield to accommodate
the extra models. This can be achieved by placing two
Kill Team gameboards side by side, or by simply using a
larger playing area.

Unless the mission you are playing instructs you
otherwise, you should then create an exciting battlefield
using any terrain features from your collection that
you wish. The best games of Kill Team are played on
battlefields that include a variety of terrain: some of it
that can hide models from view, some of it that can be
scaled to give models a better view of the battlefield,
and some of it that provides a bit of cover for models
dashing across otherwise open ground. In general, more
is better, and we recommend having at least one, or
preferably two, terrain features that can provide shelter
for a handful of models or more in each 12" by 12" area
(or each quarter of a 30" by 22" area).

Don’t worry if your battlefield doesn’t match these
requirements, but keep in mind that playing on very
small or very large battlefields, or ones that are either a
barren wasteland or filled to overflowing with terrain
features, may give an advantage to one side or the other.

KILLZONES & EXPANSIONS
If you are battling in a specific killzone (see page 44), or
if you are using a particular expansion, there might be
additional rules pertaining to setting up the battlefield,
and special rules that alter how some terrain interacts
with your warriors. Bear these in mind when creating
your battlefield.

SCOUTING PHASE
Once you have set up the battlefield, some missions
will tell you to play the Scouting phase. This phase is
described in detail on page 49, but we suggest that you
don't include this phase until after your first few games.

DEPLOYMENT
Once you have set up the battlefield (and, if relevant,
played the Scouting phase), it is time to set up your kill
teams. Each mission will explain how to do this. Once
the kill teams are set up as described in the mission (and
after anything else that the mission specifies happens
before the battle begins), begin the first battle round.

Open Play Mission: Covert WarOPEN PLAY MISSION
COVERT WAR

The time has come to prove your worth as the leader of a covert kill team. All that stands between you and
success is another kill team determined to thwart you.

THE KILL TEAMS
To play this mission, each player must first choose
a kill team from the miniatures in their collection.
Any models can be included in the kill team. We
recommend using 10 or fewer models in each kill team
in this mission.

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up terrain. Then, the
players each roll 2D6, re-rolling any tied scores. The
highest scorer has the greatest strategic advantage in
this mission, the next highest gets the second greatest
advantage and so on.

The players then must take it in turn, in the order of
greatest to least strategic advantage, to place a single
objective marker to represent sites of tactical or strategic
import. Each objective marker must be placed at least 8"
away from any other objective marker and 6" from any
battlefield edge. A player controls an objective marker if
there are more models from their kill team within 2" of it
than there are enemy models. Models that are shaken do
not count. Whenever you measure to or from an objective
marker, always measure to the centre of the marker.

The player with the greatest advantage then rolls on the
primary objectives table to the right to determine which
is used during the mission.

SCOUTING PHASE
If all players agree to do so, resolve the Scouting phase,
as described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The player with least advantage divides the battlefield
into as many equal-sized portions as there are players
(so for a two-player game, they would divide it in half).
The players then take it in turn, in the order of greatest
to least advantage, to decide which portion is their own
deployment zone.

The players then take it in turn to deploy one model
from their kill team, starting with the player with least
strategic advantage. Models must be set up wholly
within their own deployment zone, more than 6" from
any enemy deployment zone. Once all players have
set up one model, they do so again in the same order,
and so on. If a player runs out of models to set up, skip
them. Once the players have set up all their models,
deployment ends and the first battle round begins.

BATTLE LENGTH
The battle lasts for five battle rounds.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
At the end of the battle, the player who has the most
victory points wins a major victory. If more than one
player is tied for the most victory points at the end of
the battle, the player amongst them who had the least
strategic advantage wins a minor victory.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES TABLE

D3 VICTORY CONDITION

1
Secure the Battlefield: At the end of the battle,
each objective marker is worth 2 victory points to
the player who controls it.

2

Retrieve the Cache: At the start of the first battle
round, but before the Initiatve phase begins,
randomly select one objective marker; remove
the other objective marker(s) from the battlefield.
At the end of the battle, the remaining objective
marker is worth 6 victory points to the player who
controls it.

3

Infiltrate: At the end of the battle, each objective
marker in an opponent’s deployment zone is worth
2 victory points to the player who controls it. (A
player can control an objective marker in their own
deployment zone, but will score no victory points
for doing so.)

41



Advanced
Rules

ADVANCED RULES
– on ice or a spoil heap, for example. Models move
over difficult terrain at half their normal rate, so 1"
of movement across difficult terrain counts as 2". For
example, to cross a stagnant pool 1½" wide would take
3" of movement. Similarly, if moving over a frozen lake,
a model with a Move characteristic of 6" would only be
able to move 3" rather than 6". This penalty applies to all
moves. Models that can FLY ignore this penalty.

Dangerous Terrain
Dangerous terrain is terrain which is hazardous, and
which might harm a model that moves through it.

Dangerous terrain includes tar pits, deep or noxious
pools, and areas of sentient and predatory vegetation.
Models move over dangerous terrain at half their
normal rate in the same way as with difficult terrain, but
as soon as they would move into dangerous terrain, or
begin their move if they are already in dangerous terrain
(unless they remain stationary), the controlling player
takes a dangerous terrain test by rolling a D6. On a 1,
that model suffers 1 mortal wound. Models that can FLY
ignore the movement penalty, as with difficult terrain,
but if they begin or end their move in dangerous terrain
(unless they remain stationary), the controlling player
takes a dangerous terrain test for that model.

Impassable Terrain
Impassable terrain is terrain that models cannot enter or
move over for any reason – it might be instantly lethal
to any who would enter, or simply a large, solid obstacle.

Models cannot move into impassable terrain.

Climbing
Models can climb or traverse barriers of 1" or higher,
and when they do so you measure the distance as you
would normally for the kind of terrain they are moving
through. A model that climbs cannot end its movement
while climbing – it must be standing on a surface at
the end of its movement. If it does not have sufficient
movement to climb to a suitable surface, it cannot climb.
A model can traverse an overhang while climbing, as
long as it protrudes less than 1" from the surface the
model is climbing.

Models that can FLY ignore these rules – they can move
vertically without measuring the distance moved.

This section includes a variety of rules which add further detail and complexity to the game. They are not
necessary in order to play, so they have been gathered together here for players to use if they wish. We
recommend that new players ignore this section to start with, until they are familiar with the core rules.

TERRAIN
You’ve already encountered some rules for terrain – a
model shooting at a target that is obscured (which will
often be by terrain) finds it harder to hit their target and
may find it harder to take them out of action. This section
introduces further rules for terrain, covering how your
models move through different kinds of terrain and
what effect the terrain has on them. Some of these rules
override the core rules for movement, so make sure you
have agreed with your opponent(s) whether or not you
are using these rules before beginning your game.

Types of Terrain
Terrain is described as open ground, difficult terrain,
dangerous terrain or impassable terrain. Each has a
different impact on your models, as described on this
page. The rules for some terrain features tell you which
kind of terrain they are. For all other terrain, before
the game begins but once terrain has been set up, you
should agree with your opponent(s) what is considered
to be open ground, what is difficult or dangerous
terrain, and what is impassable.

Some types of terrain slow a model’s movement.
Where this is the case, it applies to all of that model’s
movement, whichever phase it occurs in. Where a
model moves a random distance (for example, when
charging), the value is determined normally and then
affected as described below.

Open Ground
Open ground is terrain that is relatively flat and free of
obstacles and hazards.

The battlefield surface, the floors of buildings and ruins,
platforms, connecting walkways, doors, hatches and
ladders are all considered to be open ground. Some
windows may also be considered to be open ground for
some smaller models – make sure you have discussed
this with your opponent(s) before the game. Models can
move across open ground without penalty.

Difficult Terrain
Difficult terrain is terrain where models might lose their
footing, or have to scramble over obstacles.

Difficult terrain includes steep or treacherous slopes,
dense stands of foliage, pools of non-hazardous liquid,
and any surface where models might lose their footing

42



Barriers, Gaps and Leaping
Walls, pipes, barricades and other low obstacles form
barriers that a model can either go around or leap over. A
model can leap onto a barrier less than 1½" high without
having to include the vertical distance when determining
how far they have moved. In addition, a model can leap
over a barrier less than 1½" high and no more than 1½"
deep without having to include the vertical distance when
determining how far they have moved.

A model can also leap over a gap between two pieces of
terrain (e.g. from one walkway to another), as long as
the gap is less than 2" across, the model has sufficient
movement to reach the other side of the gap (so that
their base is entirely on the other side of the gap), and
the model ends its move less than 1" higher than before
it leapt. Note that if the model ends its move 6" or more
lower than before it leapt, you will need to use the rules
for jumping down (see below). When a model leaps, you
do not have to include the vertical distance moved when
determining how far the model has moved.

Models that can FLY ignore these rules – they can move
over barriers and gaps without penalty.

Falling
Many terrain features have exposed edges, dangerous
precipices, or precarious walkways. Before the game
you should agree with your opponent(s) which terrain
features it is possible for a model to fall from. Almost all
buildings and ruins with more than one level are good
examples of this.

Falling Tests
If a model is on such a terrain feature and within 1" of
the edge when they are hit by an attack (or if something
other than an attack causes them to lose a wound), they
may be knocked off the edge. After all the attacks from
the attacking model have been resolved against that
model (or the wound has been lost and the Injury roll
made if necessary), the player who controls that model
takes a Falling test by rolling a D6. On a 2+, the test is
passed and the model does not fall. On a 1, the test is
failed and the model is knocked off the edge. Move the
model over the edge by the shortest route possible, then
straight down until they hit a lower level.

Falling Damage
Roll a D6 for every full 3" the model has fallen. For each
roll of 5+ they suffer 1 mortal wound. If the falling model
would be placed on top of another model, make another
roll as described above for the model underneath, using
the same number of dice as for the falling model. The
controlling player of the falling model makes any Injury
rolls that result from a fall. After resolving any Injury
rolls, the falling model is placed as close as possible to
the point where they would have landed. This can bring
them within 1" of an enemy model.

Jumping Down
A model standing somewhere it could fall from can
choose to jump down from one level to another. When
they do so, use the normal falling rules but roll one
fewer dice than you normally would. For example, if a
model jumps down 5" you do not have to roll a dice for
them; if they jump down 6", however, you would roll 1
dice for them. A model jumping down cannot choose
to fall on top of another model, and cannot jump down
within 1" of an enemy model, unless they are making a
charge move and that model was a target of the charge.

As the gap between the ruins is less than 2", the Neophyte
Hybrid can leap from one to the other.

The Neophyte Hybrid fails their Falling test, so they are
moved over the edge by the shortest route, then down.

As the pipe is less than 1½" tall or 1½" deep, the Ranger
can leap over it without counting the vertical movement.

1 Deserted Habs: No additional rule.

Abandoned Munitions: One extra model in each kill

with in each battle round.

3 Smoke in the Air: All players must subtract 1 from theirhit rolls in the Shooting phase.

4 Traps: The upper floors of ruins are dangerous terrain.

5

Tunnels: If a model from your kill team begins your turn
in the Movement phase within 1" of a manhole and more
than 1" from any enemy models, and they are not shaken,
they can enter the tunnels. When they do so, remove
them from the battlefield. At the end of your turn in the
Movement phase of the next battle round, you can place
that model within 1" of any manhole that is within 24"
of the manhole they used to enter the tunnels, and more
than 1" from any enemy models. They are considered
to have made a normal move. While they are not on the
battlefield, they are considered to be out of action for the
purposes of Nerve tests and checking whether your kill
team is broken. If they are not on the battlefield at the end
of the battle, they are considered to be out of action.

6
Hidden Cache: In a campaign game (see page 204), the
player who wins the mission gains 1 Materiel. Otherwise,
there is no additional rule.

KILLZONES
It is a vast galaxy, and wars are fought across all kinds of battlefields. From shattered city streets to
sprawling refineries and shell-pocked plains, kill teams must contend not only with their foes, but also the
environments in which they operate.

When you have chosen a mission for your game of Kill
Team, you may decide that it is fought in a particular
killzone. This book includes rules for one killzone – the
Sector Imperialis – but rules for other killzones are
available in other Kill Team products. Each killzone has
its own rules that govern how your models interact with
the battlefield and terrain, and these rules are used in
addition to the rules for terrain on pages 42-43.

In many cases the killzone you fight in will be
determined by the gameboards and terrain in your
collection, or by the mission you are playing. However,
where you have a choice of killzones and the players
cannot agree, the players should roll off. Whoever wins
decides which killzone the battle is fought in.

KILLZONE: SECTOR IMPERIALIS
Shattered streets and ruins stretch for miles in all
directions. Kill teams must pick their way through
the blasted remains of the lives of whatever luckless
civilians dwelt here as they hunt for their objective.

If you are playing a mission in a Sector Imperialis,
one player rolls a D6 once the battlefield has been
set up but before kill teams are set up, and consults
the environment table to the right to determine what
additional rule is used for this mission. In addition, if
you are playing a mission in a Sector Imperialis, players
can use any Sector Imperialis Tactics they have (these
can be found in other Kill Team products).

On a battlefield with tunnels (see the Environment table,
above) these manholes allow models to move underneath
the battlefield.

44



On a battlefield with traps (see the Environment table,
opposite) the Skitarii here would be in dangerous terrain,
while the Neophyte Hybrid wouldn't be.

Battles

DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY
Kill Team is a game that pits groups of diehards against
one another, but beyond that core premise there is huge
variety in the games you can play and the stories you
can tell. The different ways of playing are described here
under three headings – open play, narrative play and
matched play.

OPEN PLAY
Open play is the least restrictive type of gaming because
it can be as simple or as complex as you like. All you need
to play an open play game are your painted miniatures,
their datasheets, the Kill Team core rules, a mission, a
set of dice, a tape measure and a flat surface on which to
play. Then, just set up your models and begin the battle!
A simple mission to get you started is included on page
41, and there are some additional ideas and missions on
pages 50-51. You can add extra dimensions to your open
play games by incorporating any of the rules or guidelines
that appear in this and other Kill Team products, or
invent missions and rules of your own.

MATCHED PLAY
Matched play games allow for kill teams to be tested
against each other under conditions that give no
particular advantage to either side, to see which kill
team is strongest and which commander is canniest. Kill
teams in matched play games are chosen following a set
of rules that mean players can be sure that their forces
will have a fair fight. Key to these rules are the points
values that are given to each model and piece of wargear
in matched play. You can find these values at the end of
each Faction section in this book.

Matched play is ideal for competitive play as it provides
clear guidelines on the size and strength of the kill teams
taking part, as well as ensuring that all battles are as fair
as they can be.

NARRATIVE PLAY
Narrative play games are all about telling stories in the
grim darkness of the far future. This can be as simple as
devising a reason for two kill teams to battle each other,
such as a deep-seated rivalry or a vital objective that
must be secured. Creating a setting like this turns Kill
Team into more than a competitive game, as each battle
is woven into the ongoing story of the war-torn galaxy.

There are endless ways to build a story into your
games. Kill teams might be modified to better reflect
the plot, specific terrain might play a part in recreating
the landscape and ‘house rules’ might be invented to
represent the consequences of victory and defeat. There
are a number of missions available in this book that
represent some of the most common archetypes for
these stories (pg 52-55). By linking together the narrative
battles you fight, you can turn a story into a saga in which
your kill team are the protagonists. The campaign rules in
this book (pg 202-205) help you create such a tale.

NO WRONG WAY TO PLAY
Each mission in this book tells you what type of play it
is designed for. However, there’s nothing stopping you
from taking elements from a mission meant for matched
play and using it for a narrative play game, or taking one
of the narrative play missions and basing an open play
game on the core idea of that mission. It’s up to you!

SCOUTING PHASE
This section introduces the Scouting phase – a phase
that takes place before the battle and represents the kill
teams’ efforts before they engage in direct conflict.

TACTICS
Some of the missions that follow in this section include
Tactics that one or more players gain access to during
that mission. For more information about Tactics and
how to use them, see pages 64-65.

OBJECTIVE MARKERS
Many missions include objective markers. Each objective
marker should be around 1" across. When a mission
includes objective markers it will tell you how to set them
up, but if you are unable to place an objective marker as
described by the mission (e.g. because there is terrain in
the way), you can instead place it as close as possible to
its correct position. Whenever you measure to or from
an objective marker, unless stated otherwise measure to
the centre of the marker, and when measuring to another
objective marker or the edge of the battlefield, only
measure the horizontal distance. A player controls an
objective marker if there are more models from their kill
team within 2" of it than there are enemy models. Models
that are shaken do not count.

COUNTLESS BATTLES
In a galaxy at war there are no limits to the kinds of missions your kill teams will undertake, and no end to the
dangers they face. Kill Team gives you the freedom to play the games you want, how you want, as described here.

48



Scouting Phase

Once you have chosen a mission and your kill teams,
and set up the battlefield, but before you set up your kill
teams, you play the Scouting phase. This phase is used
to determine the success of each kill team’s planning,
preparing and manoeuvring before the battle, and may
have an impact on how the kill teams are set up, how the
terrain affects the battle, and so on.

In the Scouting phase, each player secretly chooses one
of the following strategies by hiding a D6 behind their
hand with the relevant number showing on the top face
of the dice.

1. Scout Out Enemy Forces
2. Plant Traps
3. Disarm Traps
4. Scout Out Terrain
5. Take Forward Positions
6. Eliminate Sentries

Once all players have done so, they reveal their choices
simultaneously, with the effects described below.

Once they have done this, the Scouting phase is over
and the players continue with deployment.

1. Scout Out Enemy Forces
If you choose this strategy, you can set aside up to 20
per cent of the models in your kill team (rounding up)
during deployment. For example, if you have 5 models
in your kill team, you can set aside 1 model, if you have
3 models in your kill team, you can set aside 1 model,
and if you have 20 models in your kill team, you can
set aside 4 models. Once all kill teams have been set up,
you can then set these models up, following the rules for
deployment in the mission you are playing. If more than
one player chooses this, you must roll off. Whichever
player wins gains the benefit of this strategy. The other
player(s) gain no benefit.

2. Plant Traps
If you choose this strategy you can booby-trap up to
D3 pieces of terrain, other than impassable terrain, that
are no bigger than 8" in height, length or width. Before
any models are set up, you must choose which pieces
of terrain your kill team has booby-trapped, and note
those down clearly on a piece of paper. If an enemy
model moves within 1" of one of these terrain pieces, or
begins their move within 1" of one (unless they remain
stationary), they trigger the booby trap: reveal to your

opponent(s) that the terrain is booby-trapped, and roll
a D6 for the enemy model. On a 1, they suffer 1 mortal
wound. Models that can FLY do not trigger the booby
trap unless they begin or end their move within 1"
of a booby-trapped terrain piece (and do not remain
stationary). After the model’s move is complete, enemy
models treat that piece of terrain, and all open ground
within 1" of it, as dangerous terrain. It is no longer
booby-trapped.

3. Disarm Traps
If you choose this strategy, choose an enemy player
who chose the Plant Traps strategy. That player’s
strategy has no effect. If there is no such player, your
strategy has no effect.

4. Scout Out Terrain
If you choose this strategy, choose up to D3 pieces of
difficult or dangerous terrain (each piece of terrain can
be no bigger than 8" in height, length or width). Your
models can move through this terrain without penalty
in this mission. In addition, if a friendly model suffers a
mortal wound from this terrain, roll a D6. On a 5+, that
mortal wound is ignored.

5. Take Forward Positions
If you choose this strategy, once all kill teams have been
set up but before the first battle round begins, up to
20 per cent of the models in your kill team (rounding
up) can make a normal move as if it were your turn in
the Movement phase. If more than one player chooses
this strategy, those players must roll off. Whichever
player wins gains the benefit of this strategy. The other
player(s) gain no benefit.

6. Eliminate Sentries
If you choose this strategy, once all kill teams have been
set up but before the first battle round begins, up to 20%
of the models in your kill team (rounding up) can make
a shooting attack as if it were your turn in the Shooting
phase. When they do so, they must target a model that
has made a normal move as a result of the Take Forward
Positions strategy. If more than one player chooses
this strategy, those players must roll 2D6 to establish
an Initiative order as if it were the Initiative phase, and
then take it in turn to resolve any attacks as if it were
the Shooting phase, in the order just established. If no
player chose the Take Forward Positions strategy, this
strategy has no effect.

SCOUTING PHASE
Operatives creep into position, eliminating sentries, disarming or laying traps and relaying information
about the distribution of enemy forces. Their success or otherwise will determine who has the upper hand
should it come to a contest of arms.

Behind Enemy
Lines

Open Play
Mission: Aerial
Strike

BEHIND ENEMY LINES

• Surrounded by a numerically superior foe, an elite
force must break out or drive off the enemy.

• A ragtag band of survivors from various units come
together in no man’s land to try to get back to their
own lines.

• A routine patrol is ambushed in dense terrain when
returning with essential intelligence. They must
escape to bring this information to their commander.

• A small band of planetary defenders must hold a
vital communications array until reinforcements can
arrive from orbit.

• Command wants to use a fleet of bombers to
annihilate the enemy headquarters, but there is only
one viable route to the target, covered by anti-air
defences. These guns must be destroyed.

Kill team operations take place under any number of unusual circumstances. On these pages you will find
three examples of open play missions for playing games of Kill Team. You will also find a few ideas below
to spark your imagination for other exciting open play games of Kill Team.

• A sorcerer is conducting a fell ritual. An army will
not be able to get past his forces, but if a small team
can defeat his elite guards they can stop the sorcerer
before he completes his work.

• A spy has been wounded while trying to escape your
camp and must be hunted down before he can get
back to his comrades.

• A key artefact was buried in a ruined city when it
fell. Your team must retrieve this artefact before the
enemy can find it.

• A traitor has gone over to the enemy! Find and
eliminate him before he can give up his secrets.

• The enemy has seeded this area with explosives. You
must disarm them all before the rest of the army can
move through.

OPEN PLAY MISSION
AERIAL STRIKE

Sometimes the only way to get troops into a critical fortified position is from above, dropping from the
sky on grav-chutes or by other means to sabotage vital enemy equipment.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two players.
Choose which player will be the
attacker and which will be the
defender (roll off if you can’t agree
– the winner decides). Each player
chooses a kill team (see page 62).

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up
terrain. The defender then places 3
objective markers anywhere on the
battlefield. Each objective marker
must be at least 6" from other
objective markers.

SCOUTING PHASE
Do not use the rules for the
Scouting phase in this mission.

DEPLOYMENT
The defender sets up their models,
anywhere on the battlefield. Divide
the battlefield into four even
quarters and number them 1-4.
The attacker then rolls a D6 for
each of their models. On a 1-4,
that model is set up in the quarter
corresponding to the number
rolled. On a 5-6, the attacker may
pick which quarter the model is set
up in. The attacker’s models must
be set up more than 4" from any of
the defender’s models.

BATTLE LENGTH
The battle automatically ends at
the end of battle round 5.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
If any of the attacker’s models are
within 1" of an objective marker at
the end of a battle round, they may
attempt to destroy it. Roll a D6 for
each of those models. On a 5+,
that objective is destroyed: remove
it from the battlefield. At the end
of the battle, each objective marker
is worth 2 victory points to the
attacker if it has been destroyed
or 2 victory points to the defender
if it is still on the battlefield. Each
player also scores 1 victory point
for each enemy specialist that
is out of action at the end of the
battle. The player with the most
victory points is the winner. If the
players have the same number of
victory points, the defender wins.

Open Play Mission: Search And Rescue

Open Play Mission: Lines Of Battle

OPEN PLAY MISSION
SEARCH AND RESCUE

When a key operative is lost behind enemy lines, the rest of their unit must retrace their steps and
locate their missing comrade before the enemy does.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two players.
Choose which player will be the
rescuer and which will be the
defender (roll off if you can’t agree
– the winner decides). Each player
chooses a kill team (see page 62).

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up
terrain. The defender places 5
objective markers anywhere on the
battlefield. Each objective marker
must be at least 4" from other
objective markers and the edge of
the battlefield. They then divide
the battlefield into even halves.

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as
described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The rescuer picks a battlefield half
to be their deployment zone and
sets up a model anywhere in that
deployment zone, more than 8"
from the enemy deployment zone.
Players then alternate setting up
models in this way. If one player
finishes deploying first, the other
player may continue to set up
models until all members of both
kill teams are set up.

BATTLE LENGTH
The battle ends at the end of battle
round 5.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
At the end of the Movement phase,
roll a D6 in turn for each objective
marker within 1" of any of your

models and more than 1" from any
enemy models (if both players can
do so, take it in turn following the
order determined in the Initiative
phase). On a 6, immediately
remove all the other markers from
the battlefield, including any yet
to be rolled for. From this point
onwards, do not make any further
rolls for objectives. At the end of
the battle, whichever player has
the most models within 2" of the
remaining objective marker is the
winner. If neither player has more
models within 2" of the objective
marker than their opponent, or if
all of the objective markers are still
on the battlefield, the rescuer wins.

OPEN PLAY MISSION
LINES OF BATTLE

Sometimes it is up to a single unit to try to hold a flank and stop the enemy from breaking through to
their defenceless support and supply trains. If they fail, the war is almost certainly lost!

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two players.
Choose which player will be the
attacker and which will be the
defender (roll off if you can’t agree
– the winner decides). Each player
chooses a kill team (see page 62).

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up
terrain. The defender then picks
one battlefield edge to be the line
they must hold.

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as
described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The defender sets up their kill
team anywhere within 6" of the
battlefield edge they must hold.
The attacker then sets up their kill
team anywhere within 6" of the
opposite battlefield edge.

BATTLE LENGTH
At the end of battle round 4, the
attacker rolls a D6. The battle
continues on a 3+, otherwise the
battle ends. At the end of battle
round 5, the attacker again rolls a
D6. This time the battle continues
on a 4+, otherwise the battle ends.
The battle automatically ends at
the end of battle round 6.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
The attacker can move their
models off the defender’s
battlefield edge, if that model’s
move is sufficient to take it wholly
over the edge of the battlefield.
A model that does so has broken
through – it is not out of action,
but takes no further part in the
mission. At the end of the battle,
the attacker scores 1 victory point
for each model that has broken
through, while the defender
scores 1 victory point for each
of the attacker’s models that has
not broken through. The player
with the most victory points is
the winner. If the players have the
same number of victory points,
the defender wins.

Narrative Play Mission: Disrupt Supply Lines
NARRATIVE PLAY MISSION

DISRUPT SUPPLY LINES
The success or failure of an army depends on how well it is supplied, and kill teams play a vital part in
both sabotaging and safeguarding supply lines. When high command receives intelligence that a supply
line is in danger, they will quickly despatch a kill team to intercept and eliminate the saboteurs.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two players. Choose which player
will be the attacker and which will be the defender (roll
off if you can’t agree – the winner decides). Each player
chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their
choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a
Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes
models with the Faction keyword they chose.

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up terrain. An example
of how you might do this is shown below. The players
roll off, and the player that wins chooses which of the
short edges of the battlefield their deployment zone
is touching. The defender then places three objective
markers in their territory. Each objective marker must
be at least 6" from other objective markers and the edge
of the battlefield.

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The players roll off, and then alternate setting up
models, starting with the player who lost the roll-off.
A player’s models must be set up wholly within their
deployment zone. If a player runs out of models to set
up, skip them. Continue setting up models until both
players have set up their kill teams. Once the players
have set up all their models, deployment ends and the
first battle round begins.

BATTLE LENGTH
At the end of battle round 4, the attacker rolls a D6. The
battle continues on a 3+, otherwise the battle ends. At
the end of battle round 5, the attacker again rolls a D6.
This time the battle continues on a 4+, otherwise the
battle ends. The battle automatically ends at the end of
battle round 6.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
At the end of the battle, each objective marker is worth 3
victory points to the player who controls it. In addition,
the attacker scores 1 victory point for each objective
marker they have destroyed, and a player scores 1
victory point if the enemy player’s kill team is broken.
The player with the most victory points is the winner. If
the players have the same number of victory points, the
defender wins.

RESOURCES
In a campaign game (see page 202) if the attacker
wins the mission, the defender loses 2 Materiel. If the
defender wins the mission, the attacker loses 1 Morale.

Narrative Play Mission: Ambush
NARRATIVE PLAY MISSION

AMBUSH
When a choke point is found, a kill team can cause significant damage to a superior force. Canny
commanders will send their kill teams to hold these areas, setting ambushes that will restrict enemy
movement and potentially cause disproportionate damage to their foes.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two players. Choose which player will
be the attacker and which will be the defender (roll off if
you can’t agree – the winner decides). Each player chooses
a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their choices at
the same time. Then each player chooses a Battle-forged
kill team (see page 62) that only includes models with the
Faction keyword they chose, but the defender can spend an
additional 20 points on their kill team.

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up terrain. An example
of how you might do this is shown below. The players
roll off, and the player that wins chooses which of the
short edges of the battlefield their deployment zone
is touching.

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The players alternate setting up models, starting with the
defender. If a player runs out of models to set up, skip
them. Continue setting up models until both players
have set up their kill teams. A player’s models must be
set up wholly within their deployment zone. Once the
players have set up all their models, deployment ends
and the first battle round begins.

BATTLE LENGTH
If the defender’s models are all either shaken, out
of action or have escaped (see right) at the end of a
battle round, the battle ends. If not, at the end of battle
round 4, the attacker rolls a D6. The battle continues

VICTORY CONDITIONS
If, at the end of the battle, more of the defender’s models
escaped (see below) than did not escape, the defender
wins. Otherwise, the attacker wins.

ESCAPE
The defender can move their models off the edge of
the battlefield labelled ‘escape route’ in the Movement
phase, if that model’s move is sufficient to take it wholly
over the edge of the battlefield. A model that escapes
this way is not considered to be out of action, but takes
no further part in the mission.

Narrative Play Mission: Feint

NARRATIVE PLAY MISSION
FEINT

By staging a suitably loud, brutal and spectacular attack, a kill team can cause enough disruption and
mayhem to make a commander believe they face a much larger force. As they hurriedly reassign troops to
where they believe they are needed, the real attack strikes at their most vulnerable spot.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two players. Choose which player
will be the attacker and which will be the defender (roll
off if you can’t agree – the winner decides). Each player
chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their
choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a
Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes
models with the Faction keyword they chose.

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up terrain. An example
of how you might do this is shown below. The players
roll off, and the player that wins chooses which of the
short edges of the battlefield their deployment zone
is touching. Starting with the defender, the players
then take it in turn to place an objective marker until
each player has placed three objective markers. Each
objective marker must be more than 5" from other
objective markers and more than 5" from the edge of the
battlefield.

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The players roll off, and then alternate setting up
models, starting with the player who lost the roll-off.
A player’s models must be set up wholly within their
deployment zone. If a player runs out of models to set
up, skip them. Continue setting up models until both
players have set up their kill teams. Once the players
have set up all their models, deployment ends and the
first battle round begins.

BATTLE LENGTH
At the end of battle round 4, the attacker rolls a D6. The
battle continues on a 3+, otherwise the battle ends. At
the end of battle round 5, the attacker again rolls a D6.
This time the battle continues on a 4+, otherwise the
battle ends. The battle automatically ends at the end of
battle round 6.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
At the end of the battle, the defender scores 2 victory
points for each objective marker that is still on the
battlefield (see the Cause Mayhem Tactic below). The
attacker scores 1 victory point for each objective marker
they have destroyed. In addition, the attacker scores
1 victory point if the enemy kill team is broken, and
1 victory point for each enemy specialist that is out of
action at the end of the battle. The player with the most
victory points is the winner. If the players have the same
number of victory points, the defender wins.

NARRATIVE PLAY MISSION

ASSASSINATE
An army without its commanders is helpless, a beast ready for the slaughter. Kill teams are often
despatched with the intent of eliminating enemy leaders, thereby disrupting the war effort in that area so
that rapid gains can be made.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two players. Choose which player
will be the attacker and which will be the defender (roll
off if you can’t agree – the winner decides). Each player
chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The players roll off, and then alternate setting up
models, starting with the player who lost the roll-off.
A player’s models must be set up wholly within their
deployment zone. In addition, the defender’s Leader
must be set up wholly within 5" of the centre of the
defender’s deployment zone. If a player runs out of
models to set up, skip them. Continue setting up models

until both players have set up their kill teams. Once the
players have set up all their models, deployment ends
and the first battle round begins.

BATTLE LENGTH
If the defender’s Leader is taken out of action, the
battle ends immediately. If not, at the end of battle
round 4, the attacker rolls a D6. The battle continues
on a 3+, otherwise the battle ends. If the battle doesn’t
end as described above, at the end of battle round
5, the attacker again rolls a D6. This time the battle
continues on a 4+, otherwise the battle ends. The battle
automatically ends at the end of battle round 6.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
If the attacker takes the defender’s Leader out of action,
the attacker is the winner. Otherwise, the defender wins.

Narrative Play Mission: Sweep And Clear

MATCHED PLAY MISSION
SWEEP AND CLEAR

When securing territory, it is imperative that all enemy forces are driven out of it, lest lurking saboteurs
strike at supposedly safe locations. Kill teams are often employed in this task, sweeping contested areas
quickly and stealthily to eliminate any threats that might still be active in the area.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two to four players. Each player
chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their
choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a
Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes
models with the Faction keyword they chose.

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up terrain. Examples of
how you might do this are shown below. Then set up
four objective markers midway between the centre of
the battlefield and the middle of a battlefield edge, as
shown in the deployment maps below.

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The players each roll 2D6. The highest scorer has the
greatest strategic advantage in this mission, the next
highest gets the second greatest advantage and so on.
Any players who roll the same result roll their dice again
to determine which of them has a greater advantage.
The players then take it in turn, in the order of greatest
to least advantage, to choose their deployment zone.
The players then take it in turn to deploy one model
from their kill team, in the order of least to greatest
advantage. Models must be set up wholly within their
own deployment zone. Once all players have set up one
model, they do so again in the same order, and so on. If
a player runs out of models to set up, skip them. Once
the players have set up all their models, deployment
ends and the first battle round begins.

BATTLE LENGTH
The battle ends at the end of a battle round if there
is only one unbroken kill team on the battlefield.
Otherwise, at the end of battle round 4, the player with
the greatest advantage rolls a D6. The battle continues
on a 3+, otherwise the battle ends. If the battle doesn’t
end as described above, at the end of battle round 5, the
player with the greatest advantage again rolls a D6. This
time the battle continues on a 4+, otherwise the battle
ends. The battle automatically ends at the end of battle
round 6.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
If the battle ends because there is only one unbroken
kill team on the battlefield, that kill team’s player wins.
Otherwise, each player scores 3 victory points for each
objective marker that their kill team controls at the end of
the battle and 1 victory point for each enemy model taken
out of action by one of their model’s attacks or psychic
powers. The player with the most victory points is the
winner. If there is a tie, whichever of those players had the
lower Force (see page 19) is the winner. If there is still a
tie, the tied players draw and any other players lose.

RESOURCES
In a campaign game (see page 202) the player(s) that
lose the mission each lose 2 Territory. If players draw
they do not lose Territory.

arrative Play Mission: Take Prisoners

MATCHED PLAY MISSION
TAKE PRISONERS

Kill team operatives are often privy to sensitive information such as the locations of high-ranking
personnel, hidden supply caches and secret routes through defensive lines. Rival kill teams may thus seek
to seize their enemies alive, so that this vital intelligence can be extracted from them.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two to four players. Each player
chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their
choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a
Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes
models with the Faction keyword they chose.

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up terrain. Examples of
how you might do this are shown below.

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The players each roll 2D6. The highest scorer has the
greatest strategic advantage in this mission, the next
highest gets the second greatest advantage and so on.
Any players who roll the same result roll their dice again
to determine which of them has a greater advantage.
The players then take it in turn, in the order of greatest
to least advantage, to choose their deployment zone.
The players then take it in turn to deploy one model
from their kill team, in the order of least to greatest
advantage. Models must be set up wholly within their
own deployment zone. Once all players have set up one
model, they do so again in the same order, and so on. If
a player runs out of models to set up, skip them. Once
the players have set up all their models, deployment
ends and the first battle round begins.

BATTLE LENGTH
At the end of battle round 4, the player with the greatest
advantage rolls a D6. The battle continues on a 3+,
otherwise the battle ends. At the end of battle round 5,
the player with the greatest advantage again rolls a D6.
This time the battle continues on a 4+, otherwise the
battle ends. The battle automatically ends at the end of
battle round 6.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
Each player scores 3 victory points for each enemy
Leader that their kill team has captured (see below) and
1 victory point for each other enemy model that their
kill team has captured. The player with the most victory
points is the winner. If there is a tie, whichever of those
players had the lower Force (see page 19) is the winner.
If there is still a tie, the tied players draw and any other
players lose.

CAPTURED
An enemy model is captured by your kill team if it
is taken out of action for whatever reason whilst it is
within 1" of a model from your kill team (excluding
shaken models) and there are no other enemy models
(excluding shaken models) within 2" of your model.
Enemy models that go out of action after the battle ends
in a campaign game do not count. The enemy model is
still considered to be out of action, and in a campaign
game the model’s player will make a Casualty roll for
them as normal.

RESOURCES
In a campaign game (see page 202) the player(s) that
lose the mission each lose 1 Materiel and 1 Morale. If

Matched Play Mission: Recover Intelligence

MATCHED PLAY MISSION
RECOVER INTELLIGENCE

Strategic intelligence is a weapon more deadly than any amount of plasma warheads or bolt rifles. It often
falls to fast-moving, hard-hitting kill teams to seize the data-augurs, orbital uplinks and the like that
contain such data and swiftly exload it so that their commanders can outmanoeuvre the enemy.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two to four players. Each player
chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their
choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a
Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes
models with the Faction keyword they chose.

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up terrain. Examples
of how you might do this are shown below. Set up
one objective marker in the centre of the battlefield,
and then set four more up; each should be midway
between the centre of the battlefield and a corner of the
battlefield, as shown on the deployment maps below.

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The players each roll 2D6. The highest scorer has the
greatest strategic advantage in this mission, the next
highest gets the second greatest advantage and so on.
Any players who roll the same result roll their dice again
to determine which of them has a greater advantage.
The players then take it in turn, in the order of greatest
to least advantage, to choose their deployment zone.
The players then take it in turn to deploy one model
from their kill team, in the order of least to greatest
advantage. Models must be set up wholly in their own
deployment zone. Once all players have set up one
model, they do so again in the same order, and so on. If

a player runs out of models to set up, skip them. Once
the players have set up all their models, deployment
ends and the first battle round begins.

BATTLE LENGTH
At the end of battle round 4, the player with the greatest
advantage rolls a D6. The battle continues on a 3+,
otherwise the battle ends. At the end of battle round 5,
the player with the greatest advantage again rolls a D6.
This time the battle continues on a 4+, otherwise the
battle ends. The battle automatically ends at the end of
battle round 6.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
Each player scores victory points for each objective
marker their kill team controls at the end of each battle
round (keep a score from battle round to battle round).
Each player scores 1 victory point for controlling each of
the objective markers closest to their deployment zone,
3 victory points if they control the objective marker
in the centre of the battlefield, and 2 victory points for
each other objective marker they control. The player
with the most victory points is the winner. If there is
a tie, whichever of those players had the lower Force
(see page 19) is the winner. If there is still a tie, the tied
players draw and any other players lose.

RESOURCES
In a campaign game (see page 202) the player(s) that
lose the mission each lose 2 Intelligence. If players draw
they do not lose Intelligence.

ched Play Mission: Terror Tactics

MATCHED PLAY MISSION
TERROR TACTICS

An enemy force whose nerve has failed them is little more than a gaggle of victims waiting to be
slaughtered. Some commanders deploy kill teams on dedicated terror raids, their mission to spread as
much panic and confusion as possible, scattering the foe and punching through their lines.

THE KILL TEAMS
This is a mission for two to four players. Each player
chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their
choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a
Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes
models with the Faction keyword they chose.

THE BATTLEFIELD
Create the battlefield and set up terrain. An example of
how you might do this is shown below.

SCOUTING PHASE
Resolve the Scouting phase as described on page 49.

DEPLOYMENT
The players each roll 2D6. The highest scorer has the
greatest strategic advantage in this mission, the next
highest gets the second greatest advantage and so on.
Any players who roll the same result roll their dice again
to determine which of them has a greater advantage.
The players then take it in turn, in the order of greatest
to least advantage, to choose their deployment zone.

The players then take it in turn to deploy one model
from their kill team, in the order of least to greatest
advantage. Models must be set up wholly within their
own deployment zone. Once all players have set up one
model, they do so again in the same order, and so on. If
a player runs out of models to set up, skip them. Once
the players have set up all their models, deployment
ends and the first battle round begins.

BATTLE LENGTH
The battle ends at the end of a battle round if there
is only one unbroken kill team on the battlefield.

Otherwise, at the end of battle round 4, the player
with the greatest advantage must roll a D6. On a 3+,
the game continues, otherwise the game is over. If the
battle doesn’t end as described above, at the end of battle
round 5, the player with the greatest advantage must roll
a D6. This time the game continues on a 4+, otherwise
the game is over. The battle automatically ends at the
end of battle round 6.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
If the battle ends because there is only one unbroken
kill team on the battlefield, that kill team’s player wins.
Otherwise, each player scores 2 victory points for each of
their models that have broken through enemy lines (see
below), and 1 victory point for each enemy model taken
out of action by one of their model’s attacks or psychic
powers. The player with the most victory points is the
winner. If there is a tie, whichever of those players had the
lower Force (see page 19) is the winner. If there is still a
tie, the tied players draw and any other players lose.

WREAK HAVOC
Any player can move their models off the battlefield
edge directly opposite their own deployment zone in
the Movement phase, if that model’s move is sufficient
to take it wholly over that battlefield edge. A model that
does so has broken through the enemy lines and takes
no further part in the mission (it is not considered to be
out of action).

RESOURCES
In a campaign game (see page 202) the player(s) that
lose the mission each lose 2 Morale. If players draw they
do not lose Morale.

KILL TEAMS

‘Each of those valiant Players was

Choosing a Kill Team

CHOOSING
A KILL TEAM
No two kill teams are alike – each is assembled to accomplish a specific vital mission, regardless of the
odds or the enemy forces stacked against them, and each contains individuals of exceptional and unique
talents that can mean the difference between defeat and victory.

maximum of any particular model, as detailed on its
datasheet.

• All models must share a Faction keyword – see
page 18.

• Your kill team cannot cost more than 100 points.
Each model and each of their pieces of wargear has
an associated points cost, as detailed in the points
section for each Faction. The total cost of your kill
team in points is referred to as its ‘Force’.

It’s a good idea to work out your kill team on a piece
of scrap paper first, as you may have to juggle the
wargear and models to get as close as you want to the
100-point limit.

NARRATIVE PLAY
If you want to play a narrative game, the mission
may dictate how you choose your kill team, or you
may decide to choose a kill team as for open play or
matched play, making whatever adjustments you feel are
necessary to create the best narrative experience.

In a Kill Team campaign, as described on pages 202-
205, you use the command roster to keep track of all
the operatives that you have used in your missions. You
can choose kill teams from the models on the command
roster, but you can also add new models to the roster
as the campaign progresses. In addition, during a
campaign battle you may wish to make notes on your
command roster or datacards to record details such as
which specialists have used a Tactic.

Forging a Narrative
We strongly encourage you to come up with some
background for your team: their personalities, quirks,
names and the like. Tables full of inspiration for this
can be found in the Faction sections of this book. Some
of these tables require you to roll a D10 – that is, a ten-
sided dice. Some others use a D66. To roll a D66, simply
roll two six-sided dice, one after the other – the first
represents tens, and the second represents digits, giving
you a result between 11 and 66.

The rules for choosing a kill team are different
depending on what kind of game you want to play. The
three ways to play Kill Team are described earlier in the
book (see page 48). Whichever way you choose to play,
you’ll complete a datacard (see opposite) for each model
in your kill team: this acts as a handy reminder for that
model’s characteristics, wargear and abilities during the
game, and also lets you record details like flesh wounds
suffered. For matched play (and narrative play, in some
cases) you will also complete a command roster that
lists all of the models available for you to choose a kill
team from.

OPEN PLAY
Simply choose a kill team from the models available
to you (using the datasheets included in this book and
other Kill Team products), choose one of those models
to be the kill team’s Leader and fill in a datacard for each
of your models. You can use any other of the rules on
this page that you and your opponent(s) agree on.

MATCHED PLAY
For a matched play game, you need to create a
command roster of up to twenty models available to
you, all of which must share a Faction keyword. You’ll
find a blank command roster on page 206. Write the
details of each of your models in the spaces provided.
Once the mission has been determined, you then choose
a Battle-forged kill team (see below) from the models on
your command roster.

Battle-forged Kill Team
For your kill team to be Battle-forged, you must adhere
to the following restrictions:

• Your kill team must consist of at least three models,
and no more than twenty models.

• Your kill team must include one (and only one)
Leader – see page 68.

• Your kill team can include up to three other
specialists – see page 66.

• Your kill team cannot include more than the

62



DATACARDS
You need to record the details of each of the models in
your kill team on datacards. You’ll find a photocopiable
page of blank datacards for this purpose on page 207.
Each datacard has spaces for you to note down all of the
most important pieces of information about a model.
Each model in your kill team needs to have one of these
datacards, and each datacard describes a single, specific
model. The example datacard at the bottom of this page
is for a Skitarii Ranger.

COMMAND ROSTER
The command roster contains a summary of all of the
models available to you. The example command roster
below is for a player partway through a campaign.

63



Command Points and Tactics

COMMAND POINTS
AND TACTICS
Having a plan is all very well, but any kill team worthy of the name must be able to adapt to the changing
circumstances of their mission – reacting in a split second to a new threat or directive, utilising special
equipment or ammunition, or simply digging deep to surpass their mortal limits.

When you choose a Battle-forged kill team, you gain
access to Command Points. These can be spent to
utilise Tactics, each of which represents a tactical asset
available to your kill team.

All Battle-forged kill teams generate 1 Command Point
at the beginning of each battle round. In addition, at the
start of the first battle round your kill team generates 1
additional Command Point for each 10 points difference
between your kill team’s Force and that of the kill team
with the highest Force (e.g. if your kill team’s Force
was 19 points lower than that of the kill team with the
highest Force, it would generate 1 additional Command
Point. If it was 20 points lower, it would generate 2
additional Command Points). Kill teams may have
other ways of generating Command Points in addition
to this. Unused Command Points can be carried over to
subsequent battle rounds until they are spent.

You can spend Command Points to use a Tactic during
a battle. Each time you use a Tactic, reduce your
Command Points total by the appropriate amount. If
you do not have enough Command Points for a specific
Tactic, you cannot use it. Unless otherwise stated, you
can use the same Tactic multiple times during the

course of a battle, but only once in any given phase.
Note that the beginning and end of each battle round
are not phases, so you may be able to use certain Tactics
multiple times at these points.

The different Tactics available to players depend on the
mission they are playing. Players can always use the
six Tactics presented on the opposite page. In addition,
each specialism has its own Tactics, presented in the
following section, each Faction has their own unique
Tactics, presented in the Faction sections of this book,
and some missions, killzones and expansions may
introduce additional Tactics to your battles.

If you are playing an open play or narrative play game,
you may choose to use the Command Point rules –
simply discuss this with your opponent(s) before the
game. Note that some Kill Team open play and narrative
missions may include Tactics – it is best to use the
Command Point rules in these games!

SPECIALISTS

CHOOSING SPECIALISTS
Experienced warriors are represented in Kill Team
with rules for specialisms, which reward you for taking
specialists on missions by giving you access to their
special abilities and Tactics.

Each model’s datasheet tells you which specialisms can
be taken by that model. When you add a model to your
command roster, you can choose one specialism for it
from those listed on its datasheet. When you choose a
specialism for a model, note that down on its datacard.
You cannot change it later.

Some models can have the Leader specialism. You must
include one model with this specialism in your kill
team, and this model is your kill team’s Leader.

For a Battle-forged kill team, you can include up to
three other models with specialisms, aside from your
Leader. Each model’s specialism must be unique – you
cannot have two models with the same specialism in
your kill team. Note that you may have more than one
of any kind of specialist (including Leaders) on your
command roster.

Each kill team is led by a hard-bitten warrior – a veteran of countless conflicts trusted with command of a
vital mission. They are supported by specialists – fighters hand-picked for the mission that are a cut above
the rest in their bravery, tenacity or skill.

ABILITIES
Each specialist has one or more abilities, depending on
how experienced they are. These abilities are set out in
an ‘ability tree’ on that specialism’s page. A specialist
starts at Level 1, and has the ability shown in the band
for that level. In a campaign, specialists gain experience
and can advance up to Level 4 (see page 204).

When a specialist advances to Level 2, choose one of
the abilities shown in the Level 2 band and make a note
of this on their datacard. Be sure to choose carefully, as
this will have a bearing on which ability you can choose
at Level 3. The specialist gains this ability in addition to
the ability gained at Level 1.

When a specialist advances to Level 3, choose one of the
abilities shown in the Level 3 band that are connected
to the ability you chose at Level 2 and make a note of it
on the model’s datacard as above – note that you cannot
choose abilities connected to the other Level 2 ability.

When a specialist advances to Level 4, you can choose
any ability from the ability tree that you have not already
chosen for them. They gain this ability in addition to
those they already have – make a note of this on their
datacard. A specialist cannot advance beyond Level 4.

Here is an example of an ability tree – that of Sniper specialists. A Sniper specialist always has the Marksman ability.
When a Sniper advances to Level 2, their player chooses whether they gain the Assassin or Sharpshooter ability.

SNIPER LEVEL 1

LEVEL 2

LEVEL 3

LEVEL 4

OR

OR

OR

Choose any ability from this ability tree that you have not yet chosen for this model.

66



TACTICS
If you have a specialist in your kill team, and they are
not currently shaken or out of action, you have access to
Tactics that are specific to that model’s specialism. Each
of these Tactics has a level: the specialist must be that
level or higher for you to be able to use that Tactic.

CAREFUL AIM

Level 1 Sniper Tactic
Use this Tactic when you choose a Sniper specialist
from your kill team to shoot in the Shooting phase.
You can add 1 to hit rolls for that model until the
end of the phase.

1 COMMAND POINT

You can use this specialist Tactic if you have a Sniper in
your kill team who is not shaken or out of action.

WORTH THEIR WEIGHT
Specialists bring valuable new abilities and Tactics
to your kill team. In a Battle-forged kill team, these
abilities carry an increased cost for that model, as shown
in this table:

Specialist Cost
Level 1 +0 points
Level 2 +4 points
Level 3 +8 points
Level 4 +12 points

Note that, in a normal matched play game, you can only
include Level 1 specialists in your kill team. The points
provided for Level 2-4 specialists allow players to choose
Battle-forged kill teams including these hard-bitten
veterans in Kill Team campaigns.

67



Leader
Specialists

LEADER SPECIALISTS
A kill team’s Leader is its brain and its heart both.
Typically the most experienced warrior in the team,
the Leader has ultimate responsibility for his warriors’
actions on the battlefield, and the success or failure of
their mission. With crisp, concise orders or bellowed
roars, the Leader inspires courage or terror in his
warriors – whatever they require to keep them in the
fight and drive them on to overcome their foes. Nor
are Leaders simple figureheads. Most are exceptional
combatants who can go blade to blade with the finest
warriors amongst the enemy ranks. With unparalleled
access to some of their forces’ most powerful weapons
and wargear, these individuals have the power to single-
handedly cut a path to victory.

FIRE ON MY TARGET

Level 2 Leader Tactic
Use this Tactic when you pick a Leader of Level
2 or higher from your kill team to shoot in the
Shooting phase. Choose another friendly model
within 3" of them that is eligible to shoot. You

models, in an order of your choice, before the
next player’s turn.

1 COMMAND POINT

FORCE OF WILL

Level 3 Leader Tactic
Use this Tactic at the start of the battle round, if
a Leader of Level 3 or higher from your kill team

Combat
Specialists

COMBAT SPECIALISTS
Some warriors excel in the close-quarters cut and
thrust of battle. Whether sublimely skilled bladesmen
who fight with absolute composure, berserk savages
who live to hack their victims limb from limb, or
calculating murderers who know every dirty trick
in the book, such warriors are an incredible asset
to their comrades. Combat specialists are ideal for
leading headlong charges into the heart of the foe, or
for rushing to intercept and put down enemies that
have broken through their own lines. They swiftly and
quietly eliminate enemy sentries, charge down ranged
combatants and butcher them up close, and often strike
the final blow to break the enemy’s nerve altogether.

DEFENSIVE FIGHTER

Level 2 Combat Tactic
Use this Tactic at the start of the Fight phase. Pick
a Combat specialist of Level 2 or higher from your
kill team. Until the end of the phase, you must

made the attack suffers 1 mortal wound after

all of their attacks have been resolved.

Comms
Specialists

COMMS SPECIALISTS
Some kill teams include a warrior whose area of
specialisation is signalling and coordination. Be it an
Imperial vox operator, an Ork Mek with a penchant
for sowing confusion, or even a Tyranid node-beast
capable of sending out powerful synaptic pulses, these
warriors can prove potent battlefield assets. Providing
their comrades with an eagle-eye view of the battlefield,
Comms specialists support and enhance the efforts of
the warriors around them. Some relay a constant stream
of orders from high command, or beam targeting data
directly to their allies, while others jam the enemy’s
communications and leave them in disarray.

SCANNER UPLINK

Level 2 Comms Tactic
Use this Tactic when you pick a model from your
kill team that is within 6" of a friendly Comms
specialist of Level 2 or higher to shoot in the
Shooting phase. That model can target an enemy
model that is not visible to them. If they do so, a
6 is required for a successful hit roll irrespective
of the model’s Ballistic Skill or any other
modifiers, even if that weapon would normally hit
automatically. The target is treated as obscured.

2 COMMAND POINTS

NEW INTELLIGENCE

rolls for that model in this phase.

Expert: Roll a D6 at the start of each battle
round if this model is not shaken. On a 5+,
you gain 1 additional Command Point. This

of the battle round if not used.

Vox Ghost: Subtract
1 from the Leadership
characteristic of enemy

models while this model
is on the battlefield, as
long as it is not shaken.

Triangulator: Once

Demolitions Specialists

DEMOLITIONS SPECIALISTS
There are those warriors for whom the rush of gunfire
or bladework simply is not enough, and whose eyes take
on a dangerous glint at the mention of high explosives.
Such Demolitions specialists excel in the deployment of
bombs, grenades and other pyrotechnic munitions, and
on a good day they can swiftly be responsible for the
explosive demise of swathes of the foe. Fireballs billow
to the skies and sundered corpses tumble through
the air as the Demolitions specialists ply their lethal
trade, and whether they are using carefully laid booby
traps, explosive launchers or roaring flamethrowers,
Demolitions specialists are terrifying warriors to face.

LUCKY ESCAPE

Level 2 Demolitions Tactic
Use this Tactic at the start of the Shooting phase.

HEAVY SPECIALISTS
In a ferocious firefight between small, elite bands of
infantry, a doughty warrior toting a suitably heavy
weapon can be every bit as devastating as a battle tank
or gun emplacement would in a larger battle. Feet
planted, heavy weapon kicking and roaring, the Heavy
specialist directs relentless hails of fire into the enemy.
Those caught in the open are blown apart, reduced to
bloody mist and spinning body parts in the blink of
an eye. Even those ducked down in cover can only fire
blindly back and scream in terror as their temporary
haven is rapidly blasted apart by round after explosive
round. Thus does the Heavy specialist act as a lynchpin
for their kill team, suppressing and slaughtering the foe
while their allies advance.

OVERWHELMING FIREPOWER

Anatomist: Re-roll
wound rolls of 1 for

this model in the
Fight phase.

MEDIC SPECIALISTS
When fighting deep behind enemy lines, squads of
warriors must be as self-sufficient as possible, for they
have little – if any – hope of receiving support or aid.
In such circumstances, a Medic specialist can prove
invaluable. Whether they be a highly trained field
surgeon, a leering flesh-stitcher or something altogether
stranger, Medic specialists concentrate on keeping
their comrades in the fight and allowing them to push
through terrible injuries to claim victory regardless.
Such warriors are instrumental in ensuring the long-
term durability of their squad, repairing physical hurts
that would otherwise leave permanent injuries, or even
fitting whole new augmetics where necessary. Of course,
their skills can also be turned to offensive purposes…

PAINKILLER

Level 2 Medic Tactic
Use this Tactic at the end of the Movement phase.

Scout
Specialists

SCOUT SPECIALISTS
In fast-paced, squad-on-squad combat, information is
key. Knowing the enemy’s disposition, feeling out their
movements, spotting traps and ambushes or locating
vital objectives to be eliminated: all of these are the
role of the Scout specialist. Ghosting ahead of their
comrades, these elite warriors are expert at tracking the
enemy to their lair, observing without being observed,
and scavenging crucial munitions and wargear that
can be turned against their former owners. Many
Scout specialists are skilled in evading the enemy’s fire,
utilising camouflage or natural stealth and agility to
defend themselves as effectively as any suit of armour
might. Others spread sedition and confusion, ensuring
the enemy’s plans fall apart even as battle begins.

MARKED POSITIONS

Level 2 Scout Tactic
Use this Tactic at the start of the Shooting phase.
Pick an enemy model within 6" of a Scout specialist
of Level 2 or higher from your kill team that is not

Sniper
Specialists

SNIPER SPECIALISTS
Many kill teams include operatives who excel in the
field of ranged combat. More than merely fine shots,
these warriors are so skilled that they can pull off feats
of marksmanship that appear nigh-on supernatural.
Like predators of the battlefield they hunt their targets,
lying concealed amidst the shadows for hours, even days
at a time. Only when the moment is perfect do they
exhale, squeeze the trigger, and place another perfect,
killing shot. Of course, every sniper has their own
areas of exceptional talent, from shooting with lethal
accuracy while on the move, to finding weak spots in
enemy armour or slaying targets far beyond what should
be extreme range. Whatever their particular skill, all
Snipers bring death from afar.

HEADSHOT

Level 2 Sniper Tactic

of Level 2 or higher from your kill team to shoot

VETERAN SPECIALISTS
Some kill teams are lucky enough to include a warrior
who has fought through dozens of war zones. These
Veteran specialists have reaped vast tallies of battlefield
experience, and are now able to share this bounty of
martial wisdom with their comrades. The Veterans’
commanders know that they can be relied upon,
absolutely and without exception, to do their duty no
matter the circumstances. Veterans know when best to
strike at the foe, and exactly where to hit them. They
have seen the worst that the galaxy has to offer and
fought on regardless, their nerves steely and their hands
steady. They know all the most important tricks to
survival, and in some cases even personalise and adapt
their weapons to be even more lethal.

WELL DRILLED

Level 2 Veteran Tactic
Use this Tactic at the start of your turn in the

Flagellant: Roll a D6
each time this model

loses a wound. On a 6 the
wound is ignored.

ZEALOT SPECIALISTS
It is a dark galaxy, and sometimes all the skill and
equipment a warrior can possess is simply no match for
sheer, bloody-minded faith. Zealots are driven by an
absolute belief in their chosen deity or particular world
view, their eyes full of fire and their conviction plain for
all to see as they storm into battle. It is their deranged
fanaticism that allows them to shrug off wounds that
ought to have killed them several times over, lends their
arm inhuman strength and allows them to inspire their
comrades to ever greater feats in battle. In extremis,
such warriors think nothing of making the ultimate
sacrifice, gladly martyring themselves for the glory of
their deity or vindication of their creed.

MARTYR

Level 2 Zealot Tactic
Use this Tactic when a Zealot specialist of Level
2 or higher from your kill team loses their last

ADEPTUS ASTARTES
ADEPTUS ASTARTES

The Adeptus Astartes, more commonly known
throughout the Imperium as Space Marines, are
Humanity’s finest warriors. Each is a genetically
modified super-soldier, a warrior of superlative skill,
courage, strength and resilience that wields the finest
weapons and wargear the Imperium can provide.

Space Marines are organised into Chapters, each a
self-contained and autonomous fighting force furnished
with its own spacecraft, fleet of armoured combat
vehicles and – in most cases – its own world or worlds
that it rules and recruits from as the Chapter’s masters
see fit. Every Chapter has its own warrior culture, its
own heraldry and traditions, and its own preferred
combat doctrines. In many cases these derive from
the tome known as the Codex Astartes, with such
exemplary Chapters as the Ultramarines, the Imperial
Fists and the Novamarines embodying its strategic
tenets. Other Chapters emphasise specific aspects of
the Codex’s teachings, from the stealth specialists of the
Raven Guard and the swift hunters of the White Scars,
to the zealous Black Templars, the noble Blood Angels
and the ruthlessly logical Iron Hands.

Space Marines are accustomed to fighting in compact,
elite strike forces, and thus form kill teams with ease.
Each battle-brother brings with him strengths and
specialisms honed on battlefields across the galaxy,
complementing those of the warriors around him to
forge an exceptionally powerful dedicated task force.
Whether despatched to assassinate a key enemy leader,
secure a site of great strategic importance, or recover a

vital dignitary or sacred artefact, the kill teams of the
Adeptus Astartes make use of their unparalleled training
and equipment to eliminate any enemy that stands
before them, completing their mission with terrifying
efficiency in the Emperor’s name.

Every battle-brother in an Adeptus Astartes kill team
is like an army unto himself, capable of tearing his way
through throngs of lesser foes or facing down the most
monstrous threats to the Imperium with a broad variety
of arms and equipment. Genetic enhancement, psycho-
hypnotic indoctrination and unfailing discipline allow
these warriors to operate at peak effectiveness for days
without rest or sustenance, allowing them to conduct
pinpoint strikes or carve paths of destruction deep
behind enemy lines, all while adapting with incredible
speed to each new threat as it develops.

The Adeptus Astartes are the Imperium’s Angels of Death. They descend from the skies upon trails of fire
to bring swift and bloody destruction to the enemies of Mankind, for they know no fear. By rolling the
appropriate dice on the tables on the following pages, you can generate names and background for your
Adeptus Astartes kill teams.

THE HOLY BOLTER
Of all the weapons used by the Emperor’s Space
Marines, none are more iconic of their might than
those that fire self-propelled micro-missiles known
as bolt shells. From the widely used boltgun and
the compact but deadly bolt pistol, to the more
specialised bolt rifles and bolt carbines of the
Primaris Space Marines, variants of bolt weaponry
are seen throughout the arsenal of the Adeptus
Astartes. Armour piercing and calibrated to
detonate inside their target for maximum damage,
a salvo of bolt shells can put paid to even the most
formidable foes.

DEATHWATCH
DEATHWATCH

The Deathwatch are the foremost alien hunters in the
Imperium. Their ranks comprise the finest warriors of
the Adeptus Astartes Chapters, seconded with great
honour to serve in the kill teams of the Deathwatch and
defend Humanity from the xenos menace.

Deathwatch kill teams make use of every weapon,
technology and tactic they can, adapting their way of
war to best suit each new foe. They carry a wide variety
of armaments, many tailored to the elimination of
particular types of enemy, and each warrior’s battlefield
expertise is leveraged to lethal effect. By combining
the greatest strengths of the Space Marine Chapters,
and deploying groups of specialist battle-brothers who
complement one another’s abilities, Deathwatch kill
teams have earned their place as one of the most lethal
precision tools available to the lords of the Imperium.

Experts at assessing how their might can best be put to
use against significantly more numerous enemies, even
in large-scale conflicts the Deathwatch will utilise small
squads of elite warriors to systematically eradicate their
foes. Though they are few in number – even compared
to the wider Adeptus Astartes – a single Deathwatch
kill team, delivered to the right location at the right
moment and equipped with the correct weapons – can
change the course of an entire war. They are heroes all,
merciless destroyers of the xenos threat, and without
their selfless efforts the Imperium would surely have
been torn apart long ago.

The Deathwatch is Humanity’s shield against xenos horrors. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables
on the following pages, and the name tables from the Adeptus Astartes section, you can generate names
and background for your Deathwatch kill teams.

D10 BACKGROUND: TEAM DOCTRINE
1 Aquila Kill Team: This kill team is assembled to deal with any threat, adapting quickly to the developing tactical situation.

2 Furor Kill Team: A kill team whose composition and armaments prioritise optimised firepower.

3 Venator Kill Team: Fast-moving and deadly, the Venator Kill Team runs its prey to ground with ease.

4 Dominatus Kill Team: This kill team specialises in meeting the enemy’s elite warriors head-on and slaying them to the last.

5 Malleus Kill Team: The monstrous and the mechanical are the chosen prey of this kill team, whose weapons pack aphenomenal punch.

6 Purgatus Kill Team: They who strike the head from the body, this kill team excels in taking down alien overlords.

7 Fortis Kill Team: Comprising heroic Primaris battle-brothers from the Space Marine Chapters, this kill team can deal withany foe.

8 Mission Survivors: The last warriors standing from a larger, now-decimated force, this kill team must fight as one to avengetheir fallen.

9 The Long Hunt: Brothers have come and gone, but the hunt has endured for decades. Now, at last, this kill team nearsits prey.

10 The Shield that Slays: Gathering the optimised combination of warriors from all those available, this kill team is perfectlybalanced for the conflict at hand.

Deathwatch Kill Teams

DEATHWATCH KILL TEAMS
DEATHWATCH models in your kill team use the Special Issue Ammunition ability below. If every model in
your kill team has the DEATHWATCH Faction keyword, you can use Deathwatch Tactics.

Special Issue Ammunition: When this model fires
an auto bolt rifle, bolt carbine, bolt pistol, bolt rifle,
boltgun, combi-melta (boltgun profile only), combi-
plasma (boltgun profile only), heavy bolt pistol, stalker
bolt rifle or stalker pattern boltgun, you can choose one
kind of ammunition from the table to the right, and
apply the corresponding modifier.

Fortis Kill Team: When you add an Intercessor (pg
85) or a Reiver (pg 85) to your command roster (and
create its datacard) you can choose for it to have
the DEATHWATCH Faction keyword instead of the
ADEPTUS ASTARTES Faction keyword. If you do so, it
gains the Special Issue Ammunition ability but you must
use the points values on page 91 for its ranged weapons.

SPECIAL ISSUE AMMUNITION

workings of xenos anatomy, always ready to carve up
aliens to better understand the hated foe.

4

comrades fall, too many xenos atrocities, and his hate
for all aliens burns hot.

5 Tactician: This warrior’s mind is a rich repository oftried and tested combat manoeuvres.

6
Huntsman: Once this battle-brother sets his eyes upon
a particular quarry, he harries them to the exclusion of

exceptional shot.

8 Grim: This battle-brother is under no illusions that theImperium is fighting a battle against impossible odds.

xenos and all their works, and his disgust for them finds

that he cannot restrain his violence against them any
more, hacking them to pieces with bloody fury.

prevent corruption.

2 The Cull: Xenos numbers in this region must be heavilycurtailed before they reach critical mass.

xenocult brood-shrine, the source of this region’s
corruption must be rooted out and put to the torch.

6
Knowledge is Power: Even as a campaign progresses
against the enemy they must be studied, dissected and
catalogued, the better to exploit their weaknesses.

D6 SQUAD QUIRK: TEAM FACET

1
Newly Forged: This kill team has recently been
assembled, and its battle-brothers must learn quickly
how to fight as one.

2
Xenovendetta: Long years of battle against a particular
xenos foe have made these warriors expert at
their annihilation.

3
Competitive: The battle-brothers of this kill team strive
not only to win victory for the Imperium, but to best
one another in private contests of arms.

4
Pragmatic: Comprised of battle-brothers from the more
subtle and sombre Chapters, this kill team relies upon
their wits and fortitude to win victory.

5

greater threat than the foul Daemons of Chaos. The
Grey Knights were created to battle these unnatural
terrors, an entire Chapter of psychically gifted Space
Marines whose mental, spiritual and physical purity are
beyond question. They sally forth from their fortress
monastery on Titan in sanctified warships to hunt down
daemonic infestations, seal hellish warp portals, and slay
those who – through accident or design – threaten to
unleash the entities of the empyrean upon realspace.

The Grey Knights’ campaigns are aided by the
Prognosticars, battle-brothers gifted with the power to
scry and to interpret glimpses of the Imperium’s future.
Grey Knights kill teams are alerted to those locations
where especially terrible daemonic incursions or dread
daemonic plots are soon to develop, and are given
insight into where their strikes can wreak the most
damage upon the forces of the enemy. Furthermore,
each Grey Knight in a kill team can draw upon their
own psychic might to strike at their foes.

Despite their small numbers, Grey Knights kill teams
wield exceptional power. Each battle-brother is armed
with the specialised wargear of his order – sanctified
bolters, psychically charged Nemesis force weapons and
warded armour of blessed adamantium and silver. Such
a kill team can easily slaughter their way through dozens
upon dozens of foes, piling their corpses high until none
remain to endanger the Imperium.

An ancient order of Space Marines shrouded in mystery and legend, the Grey Knights are Humanity’s
greatest defence against the threat of daemonkind. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the
following pages, you can generate names and background for your Grey Knights kill teams.

ASTRA MILITARUM
ASTRA MILITARUM

The Astra Militarum make up the vast bulk of the
Imperium’s standing armies. Tithed in their billions
from worlds across the Imperium, these soldiers
undergo swift and brutal training, often en route to
their designated war zone. Unlike the more elite arms
of the Imperial war machine, the soldiers of the Astra
Militarum lack the advantages of genetic enhancement
and sophisticated weaponry. Their arms and armour,
their battle tanks, artillery pieces and aircraft are all
mass-produced and hurled into battle in vast numbers,
there to wear the enemy down through attrition and
belligerent application of overwhelming firepower.

Casualty rates amongst the Imperial Guard are beyond
horrific; if a freshly recruited soldier survives more than
their first fifteen hours in battle, they are considered
an accomplished veteran. Yet despite the horrors they
must face, despite the odds that are stacked against
them and the likelihood of their own imminent demise,
these courageous men and women follow their orders
and march out to fight the Emperor’s wars, for they
know that the fate of all of Humanity rests upon their
shoulders.

The soldiers of an Astra Militarum kill team are
equipped with an array of reliable, if basic, weapons
and wargear. In order to survive, every Guardsman
must learn quickly to wield this weaponry against all
manner of fiendish traitor monstrosities and hulking
xenos warriors. Faced by such terrifying enemies,
these men and women must steel their nerve and
stride out to confront these threats to the continued

The Astra Militarum is the sledgehammer of the Emperor, and its countless armies form the vast majority
of the Imperium’s military might, relentlessly pounding their enemies with shot and shell until nothing is
left but a cratered wasteland. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the following pages, you can
generate names and background for your Astra Militarum kill teams.

existence of Mankind. Typically only a fraction of an
Astra Militarum kill team’s soldiers survive their first
excursion, yet through grit, determination and sheer
weight of numbers they grind their foes into oblivion.

Astra Militarum kill teams take many forms. Often
they are comprised of a team of grizzled veterans
supplemented by newer recruits. At other times
regimental survivors or scouting troops find themselves
fighting behind enemy lines, banding together to
increase their chances of survival and victory. Whatever
its composition, an Imperial Guard kill team has the
numbers, the faith and the firepower to bring down
any foe – and though they may face the most dreadful
hardships with little more than a lasgun, a bayonet and
a whispered benediction to the immortal Emperor, they
will pay any cost to secure victory.

THE UBIQUITOUS LASGUN
The lasgun is the standard-issue rifle of the
Imperial Guard, and there are many models,
marks and patterns in service. The Cadian
Shock Troops commonly bear the M36 lasrifle,
a weapon well known for its reliability. The
Catachan Jungle Fighters use the Mk 4 lascarbine,
the hefty power cells of which give the weapon
additional clout both as a short-range assault
rifle and an improvised club. Many other marks
exist throughout the Imperium, from the mass-
produced to the exotic, and even weapons for
dedicated mechanised or drop regiments.

6 Xenos Hunters: This squad has fought many battles against a particular alien foe, and has learned how best to kill them.

7 Seen Too Much: The mind of man can take only so much horror. These soldiers have been pushed far beyond that line.

8 Chem-addicts: The members of this squad habitually use chemical stimms to enhance their strength and banish their fear.Of course, such an addiction has its drawbacks…

9 Gone Native: So long has this squad been in the field that its soldiers have become almost feral.

10 Killer Rep: Everyone knows that you don’t get in this squad’s way – not if you value your life.

97



D10 SPECIALISTS’ DEMEANOURS
1 Dutiful: Orders must be followed to the letter, for such is the Guardsman’s lot.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS

THE FORGE WORLDS
Though they first rose to prominence on Mars, the
priesthood of the Adeptus Mechanicus spread out
across the stars during the earliest days of Imperial
expansion. They claimed many planets as their
own sovereign domains, and these became forge
worlds. From Triplex Phall to Ryza, Metalica to
Gryphonne IV, each world was transformed from
a verdant and resource-rich paradise into a fortress
of seething industry, a smog-wreathed temple to
the Omnissiah. Many of the forge worlds survive
to this day, and are the principal providers of the
Imperium’s military materiel.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS

The Adeptus Mechanicus worship the Emperor in
his aspect as the Omnissiah, the god of all machines.
To the Tech-Priests presiding over their factory-like
forge worlds, mortal flesh is weak, and from ruling
magi to lowly Servitors the Adeptus Mechanicus
augment their bodies with cybernetic components,
transcending human emotion and replacing it with
cold, inescapable logic.

Their armies are made up of warriors known as Skitarii,
whose maniples are part religious procession and part
grinding, inexorable war machine. As merciless as the
engines they worship, rank upon rank of augmetic
warriors advance towards their target with guns blazing.
Safely ensconced in orbiting warships or bunker
complexes, magi inload doctrina imperatives, control
signals that pass through the Skitarii like a religious
rapture. Rendered fearless and martially optimised by
the commands of their betters, the Skitarii advance
gladly into the most hellish war zones, giving no
thought to their own survival providing the will of the
Machine God is done.

The weapons the Skitarii wield in these wars of
auto-religious conquest are ferociously destructive,
incorporating technologies so potent that they resemble
dark and murderous miracles. Loping war engines
and many-legged tanks loom over the Skitarii ranks,
their guns spitting atomising beams of pure energy and
searing arcs of actinic lightning that pass through the
enemy like vengeful ghosts and leave naught but charred
corpses in their wake.

The Adeptus Mechanicus is ancient and powerful. Hoarding and ambitious, the Tech-Priests of Mars
view the acquisition of knowledge as a holy directive. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the
following pages, you can generate names and background for your Skitarii kill teams.

Adeptus Mechanicus kill teams scour the galaxy for
information and lost archeotech, exterminating any
they deem tech-heretics. Composed of warriors who are
more machine than man, each kill team is optimised
to carry out specific sets of battlefield protocols. With
every encounter, the members of a kill team gather
more data concerning their enemy, and adapt their
subroutines to eliminate any threat.

Adeptus Mechanicus kill teams have access to a wide
array of weaponry that is unseen among other Imperial
forces. Furthermore, their cybernetics let them wage
skirmishing campaigns in environments that would
kill unaugmented soldiers, allowing them to infiltrate
enemy compounds in rad-blasted wastes or conduct
hit-and-run attacks for months on end without
sustenance or shelter. This they do for the glory of the
Machine God, and they praise him in battle through the
incantation of static-ridden psalms.

D10 MISSION: FUNCTION
1 Defend the Sacred Technologies: The gifts of the Omnissiah must be defended at any cost.

2 Recover a Holy Prize: The Omnissiah lays claim to all technologies, whether they are willingly given or no.

3 Biologis Sample Extraction: Biosamples must be taken from live subjects to further the Magi Biologis’ knowledge.

4 Strategic Martyrdom: The Skitarii must march into the guns of the foe, and through their sacrifice reveal where the enemy’sdefences exhibit exploitable weaknesses.

5 Smite a Tech-heretic: Those who profane the holy machine, be they xenos artificers or heretical Warpsmiths, must be slainby its true disciples.

6 Eliminate Heretical Machineries: The galaxy is rife with the corrupted technological works of deviants. They must bedestroyed, lest they offend the Omnissiah’s eyes.

7 Righteous Auto-castigation: The Skitarii must prove their faith by unleashing the blessed energies of their sacred electoos.

8 Root Out Techno-dissidents: Those ignorant fools that attempt to sabotage the holy machine, or decry its divine nature,must be hunted down and slain.

9 Eradicate False Testament: It is not for lesser men to judge the works of the Omnissiah’s servants, and without supposedproof there can be no judgement.

10 Victory for Logic: A supernatural threat is skewing the cogitations of the Tech-Priests with impossible variables. As it cannotexist in the first place, it must be swiftly eliminated to prevent noospheric corruption.

D10 SQUAD QUIRK: UNSANCTIONED DIVERGENCE

1 Acquisitive: Offer unto the Omnissiah his due, regardless of the obstacles that stand in your way or the false prioritiesimposed by those of the flesh.

2 Jealous Guardians: None shall lay a hand upon the holy machine, nor even look upon its iron countenance, while youmaintain your vigil.

3 Mindlessly Devout: You are but cogs, and turn only at the Omnissiah’s bidding. You act only when divine guidance strikes.

4 Requiring Re-sanctification: Skitarii too long in the field become corrupted by fragments of scrap data that can make themsluggish or unpredictable.

5 Monotask: There is purity in a singular obsession, pursued with mechanistic devotion to the exclusion of all else.

6 Pursuing Auto-perfection: Whether it be a blade thrust or the pull of a carbine’s trigger, a deed must be repeated adinfinitum until it attains the perfection of worship.

7 Cybernetic Ascension: Pain, fear, sorrow – all these are weaknesses of the flesh that have long been left behind.

8 Mercilessly Decisive: Logic dictates that the enemy must be annihilated regardless of the cost, and to you, logic is all.

9 Secretive: Behind screens of stealth technology and auspex-obfuscation, your hidden holy works proceed apace.

10 Beyond the Crux Mechanicus: Your warriors are now so blessed that they are more machine than flesh, and all the moreresilient for it.

4 Campaign Veterans: These are surviving Skitarii from a long-fought conflict, meshing like cogs to form a deadly machine.

5 Titan Guards: These Skitarii are blessed garrison guardians of a mighty god-machine, protecting the colossal war enginewhile it is quiescent, or striking at some threat beyond its reach.

6 Rad-zone Corps: Warriors whose way of war bathes the battlefield in purifying radiation, this kill team seeks to fashion apromised land in which only true servants of the Omnissiah can endure.

7 Infiltrator Clade: This is a fast-moving band of elite Skitarii poised to strike at optimal targets, be they communication relays,command centres or the enemy’s profane technologies.

8 Domination Cadre: A force assembled with endurance in mind, this kill team has been tasked with seizing and holding aspecific location or asset, regardless of cost in life.

9 Itratii Cadre: Cataloguing the capabilities of the weapons they wield, or the foes they turn them upon, is the speciality of thiskill team.

10 Corpus-Sanctarii Clade: Elite bodyguards of a high-ranking Tech-Priest, these Skitarii are duty-bound to protect him andhis works at all costs.

HERETIC ASTARTES
HERETIC ASTARTES

Heretic Astartes are dark mirrors of their loyalist
counterparts. Some of these Chaos Space Marines are
newly fallen, renegades that have turned their backs
upon the Emperor’s light in the hopes of personal
power. Others are ancient beings, the same warriors
that followed the Traitor Primarchs into damnation ten
thousand years ago during the days of the Horus Heresy.
Many exhibit twisted physiologies and sorcerous talents;
others wield strange and terrible weapons, or pursue
especially cruel ways of war.

Every Chaos Space Marine fights for themselves, for
personal gain and advancement over their peers. Some
are self-determining beings that have thrown off the
shackles of Imperial rule and seek nothing more than
to maraud across the galaxy, wreaking havoc amongst
those they were once sworn to defend. Others give their
worship to the Dark Gods of Chaos, their every deed
calculated to catch the fleeting gaze of their patron
deity – or indeed all of the Ruinous Powers – and thus
be granted boons of unnatural power beyond the ken of
mortal minds.

From the cruel siegemasters of the Iron Warriors and
the murderous terror troops of the Night Lords, to the
arch-heretics of the Black Legion, the zealous fanatics
of the Word Bearers, the duplicitous and cunning
Alpha Legion, and many more, each Traitor Legion
and Renegade Chapter fights in their own fashion, yet
all seek the same end goal: the utter annihilation of the
False Emperor’s realm. With the emergence of the Great
Rift, such is a fate that seems closer to fulfilment than
ever before.

Twisted and corrupt, the Heretic Astartes are traitor Space Marines who have fallen from the Emperor’s
grace. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the following pages, you can generate names and
background for your Heretic Astartes kill teams.

Heretic Astartes kill teams vary enormously, dependent
upon which Traitor Legion or Renegade Chapter they
hail from, and which god or gods they worship. Some
are small, elite groups of killers, while others include
throngs of chanting cultists amongst their ranks. Many
Heretic Astartes kill teams are made up of warriors
more like unto maddened bloodhounds than veteran
soldiers, whilst those truly touched by the warp are
demented and inhuman beyond all reason.

The inconstant nature of the dominions ruled over by
the Heretic Astartes breeds strange bedfellows. It is not
uncommon to see a kill team made up of worshippers
of different Chaos Gods or even the devoted servants
of rival Daemons working to outdo one another. Many
include mortal Chaos Cultists who strive to impress
their masters with their fervour, even as they struggle
to keep up with their merciless pace. Only by their
leader’s sheer willpower and lethality are they bound
into a semblance of a unified force. All, however, have
an abiding hatred for the Imperium, and a deep-seated
desire to put the galaxy to flame.

THE CHAOS GODS
The Chaos Gods lurk in the warp, twisted siblings
that vie for power both within their own realms
and over the coveted reaches of realspace. Khorne
is the Blood God, the Lord of Murder, whose
worshippers seek to offer up endless mountains
of skulls in his name. Tzeentch is the Great
Conspirator, the Architect of Fate and Master of
Magic. Nurgle is the God of Plagues, who seeks
to spread his foul gifts to all living things, while
Slaanesh, the Dark Prince, is the god of excess,
whose worshippers inflict the greatest ecstasies and
agonies on themselves and their foes.

4 Sunder the Gates: This kill team has been tasked with paving the way for a wider invasion by penetrating the enemy’sstronghold and sabotaging its defences.

5 Arcane Prize: Despatched by their powerful master, this kill team must acquire an eldritch artefact for him or die inthe attempt.

8 Hand of the Gods: This warband must strike swiftly and with overwhelming force, eliminating a key strategic asset beforevanishing into the shadows.

9 Dark Guardians: This band of killers is sworn to protect some great champion or oracle of the Dark Gods, on pain of theirimmortal souls.

10 Saboteurs: Loose behind enemy lines, this kill team seeks targets of opportunity and strikes wherever it can inflict the mostdamage upon the foe.

D10 SQUAD QUIRK: TWISTED NATURE
1 Embittered: Hatred fuels these cynical killers, and guides their every deed.

2 Berserk: This kill team views the galaxy through a red haze of murder-lust.

3 Devious: So long has this kill team used trickery and stealth to achieve their ends that their every act is obscured by lies.

4 Zealous: True devotees of the Chaos Gods, these warriors bellow praises to the dark pantheon as they fight.

6 Stolid: This kill team prefers to use defensive tactics and sheer resilience to win their battles.

7 Iron Discipline: Despite their current allegiances, these warriors still fight with all the ferocious efficiency and skill of theLegions of old.

8 Arrogant: These warriors consider their enemies to be laughably beneath them, sneering at their every effort to fight back.

9 Insane: Perhaps guided by ineffable prophecy, or finally pushed past the final boundary of rational thought, the deeds of thiskill team seem like madness to their foes.

10 Possessed: These warriors have no will of their own, having surrendered their mortal forms to divine possession bydaemonic beings.

D10 BACKGROUND: DARK PACT

1 Champions All: Once part of a far larger warband, these few warriors have endured and prevailed, winning the blessings ofthe Dark Gods where their comrades were found wanting.

2 Lost and Damned: These warriors have lost themselves entirely to madness and mutation.

3 Veterans of the Long War: Since the end of the Horus Heresy, these warriors have fought tirelessly for vengeance. They areancient and filled with hate.

4 Predators: Inhuman and terrifying, the members of this kill team act more like beasts hunting prey than trained soldiers.

5 Warp-infused Warriors: This band of killers has been saturated with the dark energies of the warp, twisting intobio-mechanical living weapons.

6 Tzeentch Worshippers: The members of this kill team are servants of the Great Conspirator, and their way of war isaccordingly convoluted and seemingly insane.

7 Khorne Worshippers: Blood for the Blood God! Skulls for the Skull Throne! The warriors in this warband are berserklunatics, and they care not from where the blood flows.

8 Slaanesh Worshippers: These warriors exist to experience – and to inflict – the most extreme physical and mental stimulithrough the medium of spectacular violence.

D10 SPECIALISTS’ DEMEANOUR

1 Ultimate Veteran: This warrior has been fighting for many lifetimes of mortals, and has honed their skills to absolute perfection.

2 Cannibal: This monstrous renegade stops by each fallen victim to rip gobbets of their flesh free with his fangs, consuming theirstrength and soul in the process.

3 Deranged: Giggling and singing dark, daemonic rhymes, this warrior appears utterly insane.

4 Blade-master: This warrior excels in duels, and seeks out the mightiest enemies to humble with his sword.

5 Visionary: Guided by portents and omens that only he can see, this warrior seems a superstitious madman or half-intelligible oracle.

6 Living Canker: This warrior is corrupt beyond mortal endurance, an avatar of foulness and mutation that taints everythinghe touches.

7 Unstoppable Force: Brutish and monstrous, this warrior smashes through everything in his path.

8 Twisted: Jealous and conniving, this warrior is utterly untrustworthy and will see anyone slain, friend or foe, if it is to his benefit.

9 True Believer: This warrior’s faith in the Dark Gods is unquestioning, his devotion absolute.

10 On the Brink: Laden down with dark boons, this warrior is a mere step away from an ascension to daemonhood, or else adebased plunge into spawndom.

This kill team has the honour of doing the deed.

6

Warp-spores: These warriors must sow the spores of
damnation throughout the region, each fresh canker
eroding reality until a full-scale breach into the Garden
of Nurgle becomes inevitable.

D6 BACKGROUND: FOUL NATURE

1
The Virulent: These warriors are infected with the
very foulest of Nurgle’s contagions, and have devoted
themselves to spreading them far and wide.

2
Dark Alchemists: This kill team takes to the battlefield
to test the virulent weapons created by the Foul
Blightspawn and Biologus Putrifiers.

3
Trench Fighters: This kill team is equipped for close-
quarters offensives, using sheer endurance and point-

6
Shepherds of the Neverdead: These warriors herd
hordes of Poxwalkers before them into battle, the better
to wear down and dismay the foe.

DEATH GUARD

For ten thousand years, the Death Guard have served
the Plague God Nurgle. Once they were a loyalist Space
Marine Legion, but during the Horus Heresy they
followed their embittered Primarch, Mortarion, into
rebellion and gave their souls to the Plague God, Nurgle.
Now their bodies are riddled with disease, inured to
an impossible level of pain by their bloated, mutated
nature. Wreathed in droning clouds of plague flies,
wielding revolting weapons that unleash weaponised
sicknesses and flesh-eating blights, these Plague Marines
spread the countless contagions of Nurgle to every
world upon which they set foot.

Death Guard kill teams tend to be compact and
incredibly durable. Tough beyond mortal measure and
wielding weapons made even deadlier by plague, they
sow the seeds of new epidemics and wars wherever
Nurgle wills it. They trudge slowly and inexorably
towards the foe, arrogant in their sheer resilience and
the belief that Grandfather Nurgle has all eternity to
lavish his gifts upon the ungrateful foe. Terror, sickness
and entropy are the weapons of these foul shock troops
– they delight in watching their enemies lose first their
nerve, then control of their bodies as the foul contagions
of Nurgle take hold, and finally their minds as they
realise their inescapable fate. Thus do the Death Guard
continue their advance over the bubbling remains of
their foes, already seeking new population centres to
enlighten with Nurgle’s most generous creed.

The Death Guard are foulness made manifest. They are a vision of unnatural corruption, of nobility, courage
and strength perverted into rancour, rot and diseased might. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the
following pages, you can generate names and background for your Death Guard kill teams.

suffering from them before the inevitable end.

unstoppably as death itself, laying down a steady hail of

1
Drudge: This warrior trudges into battle with near-
mindless stolidity, a living embodiment of misery

6
Meticulous: Slow but as relentless as the onset of a fatal

7
Deathflinger: Nothing gives this traitor more pleasure
than raining diseased explosives onto the heads of
the foe.

8

their fallen victims, selecting their treasures with an
expert eye.

THOUSAND SONS
THOUSAND SONS

The Thousand Sons are the arch-sorcerers of Chaos.
Deceit and betrayal led them to a terrible fate, and
transformed them into a terrifyingly powerful, but
ultimately damned, force of destruction. Thousand Sons
warbands launch their assaults from the strange Planet
of the Sorcerers, a world that – since the return of their
Primarch, Magnus the Red – has blighted the Prospero
System and the wider Imperium alike.

The kill teams of the Thousand Sons are often led by
potent Sorcerers of Tzeentch, whose command over
the energies of the warp allows them to engulf their
foes in mutating fires and shield their comrades behind
flickering walls of flame. Each kill team’s agenda is
always to alter the strands of fate to better suit their
needs, though sometimes even they do not realise the
part their mission plays in Tzeentch’s greater plan.
Advancing in disturbing synchronicity alongside the
kill team’s leaders come the Rubric Marines. Reduced
millennia ago to little more than armour shells filled
with semi-sentient dust thanks to a failed ritual, these
incredibly resilient warriors pitilessly turn their enemies
to ash with inferno bolts and warpflame. Mutated
beasts complete the twisted assemblage – Tzeentch-
worshipping Tzaangors that shriek in forbidden tongues
as they scavenge arcane treasures from slain foes. These
vicious creatures can tear a man in two with sinewy
claws, or hack them to pieces with their ornate blades.

The tang of sorcery taints the air as the Thousand Sons attack. Coruscating bolts of warp energy explode in
washes of mutating fire, while hails of ensorcelled rounds mow down the foe in the name of Tzeentch, Chaos
God of Change. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the following pages, you can generate names and
background for your Thousand Sons kill teams.

D6 MISSION: INEFFABLE PURPOSE

1

Ritual Desecration: This kill team must use sorcery
and flame to scour places of enemy faith, the better
to weaken their defences against the empyric and
the infernal.

2
Abduction: This kill team is hunting a specific
individual, a luckless victim who must be snatched away
to further some esoteric Tzeentchian scheme.

3
Sowing Sorcery: Upon the orders of Magnus himself,
these warriors must etch glyphs of power across the war
zone in sorcerous flame, furthering his enigmatic ends.

4
Firestorm: All must burn in the mutating fires of
Tzeentch, until nothing but glowing ash and writhing
flesh remains.

5
Vengeance for Prospero: Never can the offences of the
past be forgiven. Ever must the Emperor’s servants suffer
for what the Thousand Sons lost.

6
Hands of Fate: This kill team must perform a series of
vital tasks in order to change the fate of worlds, though
their deeds would seem almost random to an observer.

D6 BACKGROUND: PATH OF FATE

1
Heralds of Madness: This kill team seeks to drive their
enemies insane, burning away their wits amidst the fires
of magic and mutation.

2
Seekers After Sorcery: These warriors were gathered to

ASURYANI
ASURYANI

The Asuryani are amongst the most ancient of the
galaxy’s many factions. These Aeldari are sublimely
focused and terrifyingly skilled warriors, for whom war
is a path that must be trodden with absolute discipline
and mastery. For all their martial magnificence, the
Asuryani have teetered upon the brink of extinction for
millennia. They are but echoes of an empire that once
spanned the galaxy, the last survivors sailing through
the void aboard immense vessels known as craftworlds.

The ancient Aeldari empire shone incredibly bright at
its zenith, yet through obsession and moral deviance
it descended into a hellish quagmire from which the
Asuryani were amongst the few refugees to escape.
So twisted did the ancient Aeldari become that their
psychic corruption birthed Slaanesh, the Chaos God of
excess. This event, known as the Fall, saw the souls of
the ancient Aeldari consumed at a stroke, and left the
scattered survivors fleeing from Slaanesh’s grip forever
more. Only through strict asceticism and psychic
scrying of the threads of destiny have the Asuryani
avoided the terrible fate of their ancestors, yet still there
are many among their race who believe that they are
doing little but delaying their inevitable end.

Asuryani kill teams are elite forces of swift and skilful
warriors. Each combatant is armed with the optimal
weapons and wargear for their tactical niche. Their line
troops, the skilled militia known as Guardians, lay down
covering fire with hissing shuriken weapons and heavy
weapon platforms. Rangers pick off key targets with
sniping shots from elegant long-barrelled rifles.

Vast interstellar arks constructed from living wraithbone, the craftworlds of the Aeldari are marvels of
grace and beauty. No less graceful are their occupants, the Asuryani, those members of their race who
foresaw the fall of their empire and escaped its death throes. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables
on the following pages, you can generate names and background for your Asuryani kill teams.

Yet it is the warriors of the Dire Avenger Aspect Shrines,
with their ritual armaments and honed martial skills,
that lead the charge to victory.

Unlike the bands of Aeldari which make up the greater
part of the craftworld warhosts, who are grouped
together with others that follow the same battle
discipline, Asuryani kill teams can include a range
of individuals with different specialities fighting as a
coherent whole. Often they are the survivors of another
conflict, or a company of wanderers long divorced
from their homes, for the Asuryani are a race few in
number, and necessity binds them together more often
than intent. It speaks volumes of the fluid Aeldari mind
that a mix of such focused warriors still works as one,
achieving the mysterious agendas of its Farseers with a
skill and synergy most humans could only dream of.

SPIRIT STONES
Upon death, an unguarded Aeldari soul will be
drawn into the warp and there consumed by the
ever-hungering Slaanesh. To prevent this terrifying
fate, the Asuryani have taken to wearing gemstones
upon their breasts known as spirit stones. These
psycho-receptive crystals capture the soul of the
fallen warrior and preserve it in a safe haven until
it can be collected and returned to its craftworld.
There, the spirit stones are plugged into the
infinity circuit, freed to mingle with the souls of
their ancestors until the end of time, or until the
craftworld’s destruction.

130



D10 BACKGROUND: SHARED DESTINY

1 Gwynt’ar Fue: The wind that burns or, depending upon tone – vendetta hunters on a mission to slay a specific enemy ofthe craftworld.

3 Keepers of the Gate: Warriors sworn to seize and protect an asset, be it a webway tunnel, sacred shrine, or othertactical objective.

5 Shadow Squad: Masters of subtle infiltration and misdirection, who slip behind enemy lines and prepare to strike hard.

6 Echoes of Greatness: A force of survivors, fighting on for those they have lost.

7 Ily’Haeth Khai: The blade that seeks out weakness – a force assembled to exploit the enemy’s every error.

8 Cleansers: The members of this warband are united by their hatred of those lesser races who befoul the ancient demesnes ofthe Aeldari, and their abilities in exterminating them.

9 The Bladed Mirror: This kill team is comprised of warriors that excel in the use of misdirection and trickery.

10 Wardens of the Pivotal Life: A single warrior can hold in their hands the fate of millions. Such a one was this teamassembled to protect.

1 Enact the Bailic-fen: This warband must collect the spirit stones of the Aeldari that fell in recent battle.

2 Surprise Attack: The enemy are many, the objectives myriad, yet speed and manoeuvrability are the way of the Asuryani –strike quickly and without mercy.

3 Keepers of the Gate: This kill team seeks a hidden webway portal leading to a lost spar. It must be sealed from the inside.

4 Talons of Heg: This team’s mission is one of sabotage and mayhem, using subtle strikes to slow and misdirect the enemy.

5 Fate’s Executioners: Farseers predict dire events should the enemy leader survive. Hunt down this dangerous commanderand alter the skeins of fate in your favour.

7 The First Wave: This warband has been sent forth by an Autarch to inflict as much damage as they can before retreating.

8 Faolchú’s Wings: Deliver the chosen one safely through the war zone, for the Farseers have predicted that only she mightknow ultimate triumph.

9 A Greater Foe: Unbeknownst to any but the Asuryani, a new warp rift will soon open. Ancient technologies can prevent theweakening of reality from becoming a new rent, but only if deployed in the right place at the right time.

10 Mobile Defence: Slow, harry, harass – to delay the foe is to win the war.

D10 SQUAD QUIRK: DEEPER NATURE

2 Fickle: This kill team is perfectly focused on the craft of war, yet fey and whimsy creep into their decisions.

3 Merciless Hate: The remembrance of past atrocities spurns the squad to a cold-blooded harshness.

4 Sorrows Beyond Measure: Even in triumph, battle losses and the horrors of ruin wrought by barbaric forces are difficult tobear. It is no weakness to weep over the slain.

5 Psychically Attuned: This kill team possess sufficient latent psychic potential to exhibit a sort of collective sixth sense, thoughat the cost of haunting visions.

6 Uncanny Perfectionists: The Asuryani in this squad are considered amongst the most sublimely skilled of their kin.

7 Servants of Prophecy: This warband follows the directions of a Farseer’s scrying. Their deeds may seem strange at times, butthey all serve a greater end.

8 Superior: Cognisant of their status as members of the sophisticated Aeldari race, these Asuryani are not shy about pointingout the flaws of others and where they might improve.

9 A Shining Example: The demands of war are difficult enough, but the grime of battle is simply too much – the entire squadmust periodically pause to perform maintenance upon their battle gear until they are, once more, shining and resplendent.

10 Arrogant and Aloof: These warriors sneer at their barbaric enemies, and will mercilessly mock any error or misfortune.

131



D10 SPECIALISTS' DEMEANOURS
1 Acrobatic: All Aeldari bear themselves with innate grace, but some raise the artistic bar with their every fluid movement.

4 Damned: Knowing what the future holds is not always a boon.

5 Survivor’s Guilt: This warrior has seen all their comrades and loved ones die around them, spurring them to unceasingaggression against the foe.

6 Absolute Focus: All Asuryani are supremely focused, but to this warrior there is only the mission, and all will be sacrificed forits success.

7 Haughty: This warrior revels in proving their superiority over the lesser races.

8 Cold as the Void: Once upon the battlefield, all emotions are suppressed and only the dictates of purest logic will be followed.

9 Passionate: This Aeldari is consumed with burning emotions that fuel an intense battle fury.

DRUKHARI
DRUKHARI

The Drukhari are sadists, pirates and murderers all.
They are the dark kin of the Asuryani, a subset of the
Aeldari race whose peerless skill and mental focus have
been bent solely towards hedonism, self-advancement
and the infliction of pain. These legendary beings are
monsters of nightmare, hyper-intelligent and utterly
malevolent. Their technology is akin to sorcery and
their physical prowess jaw-dropping. Yet they are
hollow creatures, their beauty hiding blackened souls
that are constantly draining away like sand through an
hourglass. The only way for the Drukhari to recover
their waning life force is through feeding off the pain
and terror of other beings.

Drukhari raiding parties emerge through webway
portals from the Dark City of Commorragh. They
launch swift and deadly attacks against settled
worlds, not merely for material gain, emerging from
the shadows to take slaves and treasures, but more
importantly to bathe in the suffering they inflict upon
their foes. Such raids are typically led by the vast
syndicates known as the Kabals, or the vicious bands of
gladiatorial fighters known as the Wych Cults.

The Kabals are something akin to noble houses and
paramilitary criminal cartels combined, with every
Kabal seeking to clamber to the heights of glory atop
the heaped corpses of their rivals. By far the greatest
prestige for such organisations can be earned through
orchestrating successful raids upon realspace, with
Kabals such as the Black Heart, the Poisoned Tongue
and the Lords of Iron Thorn leading the greatest of all
such invasions. By comparison, the Wych Cults attack

The Drukhari are a race of cruel killers who feed upon agony. From the Dark City of Commorragh, their
fleets strike forth in search for new souls to torment. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the
following pages, you can generate names and background for your Drukhari kill teams.

realspace to showcase their martial talents, groups such
as the Seventh Woe, the Cult of Strife or the Cult of Red
Grief pitting themselves against the greatest enemies
they can find, the better to bask in rolling waves of
agony and terror.

Drukhari kill teams are built around fiercely competitive
cliques of elite killers, each armed for a specialised
combat role. Though these individuals often hail
from different organisations and subcultures in
Commorragh, all rivalries and vendettas are set aside
for the duration of the raid. The vicious firepower of the
Kabalites combined with the whip-fast combat prowess
of the Wyches spreads panic amongst their victims
like a raging wildfire. Each kill team strikes with the
utmost speed, ferocity and ruthlessness, stealing away
screaming captives before vanishing to leave only fear
and ruin behind them.

THE DARK CITY
Commorragh is a vast metropolis, scattered across
countless different passages of the strange realm
known as the webway. It is fractal in complexity,
immense beyond imagining and impossible for
mortal minds to truly comprehend. From its
towering, blade-like spires and lethal arenas to
its dark, Haemonculus-haunted oubliettes and
shadow-wreathed sub-dimensions, Commorragh
is a nightmarish realm in which the Drukhari rule
and all other races of the galaxy are but playthings
to be tormented, or prey to be hunted and feasted
upon at will.

138



‘We are the things that haunt the darkest recesses of the nightmares that you cannot face. We are the ones
that leer from the shadows and know the fears that you do not admit. We are the predators, you the prey,
and we shall make you scream in delicious agony before you meet your end.’

- Thraekynn Neverwhim, Sybarite of the Bladed Curse

HARLEQUINS
HARLEQUINS

To the Aeldari known as the Harlequins, the acts of
waging war and staging a performance are one and the
same. They echo the myths of the ancient Aeldari gods
in everything they do, with each Player taking on a role
in body and soul until the chosen ritualised dance is
done. Worshipping the Laughing God, Cegorach, they
have a twisted sense of humour, and appreciate irony
as a connoisseur does a fine wine – even should it work
against them.

All Aeldari loathe and fear Slaanesh, for that fell
entity was born from their race’s collective psyche,
and thirsts for their souls. The Harlequins escape
that curse through the worship of the Laughing God.
When a Harlequin dies, their soul is snatched up by
Cegorach and spirited away, safe into the webway
where Slaanesh cannot devour it. Yet there is a
price for such salvation; when an Aeldari becomes
a Harlequin, they abandon their old life altogether,
leaving behind friends, family, responsibilities and
everything that once defined them. Instead, they take
on their new role within the Troupe, and fight forever
more in the name of the Laughing God.

What precisely the Harlequins fight to achieve varies
– some seek to defeat Chaos, others to restore the
power of the ancient Aeldari, while others still watch
over ancient and sacred sites such as the enigmatic
Black Library. Yet whatever their aim, all fight with
an elegance and grace that is breathtaking to behold,
utilising polychromatic domino fields, anti-grav flip
belts and an array of lethal close-range weaponry to
confound and outfight their foes.

To the warrior-acrobats of the Harlequins, who fight for the Laughing God, warfare and art are
inseparable disciplines. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the following pages, you can
generate names and background for your Harlequin kill teams.

Harlequin Troupes – each effectively a kill team in its
own right – travel across time and space, using the
secret labyrinth dimension of the webway to strike
suddenly at critical targets, falling upon their prey in
a storm of acrobatic attacks and graceful sword blows.
As a Troupe, they will take on an aspect of the Light,
the Dark, or the Twilight that exists between the two.
As individuals, each Harlequin’s role will dictate their
fighting style – the Hidden Prince, for example, will use
his flip belt to descend from above before neatly taking
his foe’s head in a single stroke, whereas the Bladed Fool
will caper and prance, untouched by any attempted
reprisals, until he ‘accidentally’ slashes the throat of his
foe. The ancestral enemies of all Harlequin Troupes are
the scions of the Dark Gods, and those of Slaanesh in
particular, but any who stand in their path risk being
artfully despatched.

THE WEBWAY
The webway is a labyrinth dimension that
exists between realspace and the warp. Though
damaged by the ravages of time, this interstellar
maze allows travel across space with impossible
swiftness; journeys that would take starships
many weeks or months to complete can be made
on foot via its twisting passages in a matter
of hours. Yet the webway is dangerous. The
Harlequins of the Laughing God are the only
faction in the galaxy who can tread its pathways
without fear, and even they treat their strange
realm with a respectful wariness.

NECRONS
NECRONS

Ancient beyond reckoning and utterly without mercy,
the Necrons are soulless creatures whose skeletal bodies
are formed from living metal. In aeons past these beings
ruled the galaxy with an iron fist, until the accumulated
losses of their ceaseless wars of conquest forced them to
retire to stasis-crypts deep beneath the surfaces of the
planets under their sovereignty. There they slumbered,
awaiting a time when their many enemies were weak
and ripe for domination. Millions of years later the
Necrons have emerged, and their multitudinous legions
march forth across the galaxy at the behest of the proud
and imperious Necron Overlords.

When the Necrons vanished into their hidden stasis
crypts more than sixty million years ago, they were
counted amongst the most powerful species in the
galaxy, and their worlds spread across the stars in great
profusion. Through the long millennia, many of these
tomb worlds have been lost to catastrophe, while others
have undergone such radical shifts in climate or geology
that the tomb complexes beneath their surfaces have
been irreparably damaged or destroyed.

Yet many more have merely been settled by the galaxy’s
younger races, who now find strange ruins and the
yawning mouths of glowing crypts rising from beneath
their feet. The Necrons are awakening to discover that
their empire of old teems with what they see as nothing
more than fleshy vermin. They have little patience for
such creatures, with the vast majority seeking simply
to eradicate the infestations as their first step upon the
road of restoring their glories of old.

Advancing in inexorable lockstep come the deathless legions of the Necrons, eldritch energy crackling
from their ancient weapons. They have risen to reclaim the stars, and none shall stand in their way. By
rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the following pages, you can generate names and background
for your Necrons kill teams.

Necron kill teams are chosen by an Overlord from
amongst his most favoured warriors. They are invariably
led by elite troops such as Immortals, for unlike the
mindless Warriors such Necrons have retained some
of their individuality and extensive combat experience
during the long sleep. That said, the unthinking foot
soldiers of the dynastic legions have their uses – the
leader of a Necron kill team can trust these automatons
to march into the thickest hails of enemy fire in order
to capture vital locations, or retrieve objects of value
desired by their master. For more delicate missions
– whether assassination, the gathering of subjects
for mindshackle interrogation or perhaps the violent
humiliation of a rival – the Necron Lord will make use
of more specialised troops. Thus, Necron kill teams can
vary greatly in composition, though their predominant
strategy is to obliterate their foes from afar with a
relentless storm of atomising gauss energy.

GIFTS OF THE CRYPTEKS
Necron technology is so incredibly potent that
to many races it appears indistinguishable from
sorcery. Created by the technomancers known
as Crypteks, it enables their armies of conquest
to teleport to and from the battlefield seemingly
at will, and allows grievously damaged Necron
warriors to rapidly self-repair or even phase out of
reality altogether. Most terrifying of all, it provides
Necron soldiery with weapons that can flay their
victims apart on an atomic level, wreathe them in
arcs of lethal energy, or reduce them to glowing
ashes in the blink of an eye.

D10 MISSION: GLORIOUS TASK

1 The Cull: All sentient non-Necron lifeforms must be exterminated without mercy or exception.

2 Mindthieves: A prominent enemy leader has been slated for mental domination through the application of mindshacklescarabs. This kill team must perform the forced indoctrination.

3 Servants of the Crypteks: This kill team has been charged with testing the deadly weapons of the Crypteks upon a variety ofliving specimens and reporting the results.

4 Heralds of the Uprising: In order to awaken a major tomb complex, specific locations above ground must be seized andinvested with Necron technologies.

5 Chrono-aquisitors: Below the planet’s surface, a tomb complex stirs. This kill team must disrupt the lesser races and, in sodoing, buy time for the awakening to proceed.

6 Fractal Disruption: Following an exacting, hyper-logical plan, this kill team must eliminate a series of enemy supply andcontrol assets to cripple the foe.

7 Punishment Detail: These warriors have failed their Overlord in some way and, on his whim, have been sent on a desperatemission to atone or be destroyed.

8 Relentless War: This kill team has been prioritised for resurrection protocols, and charged with fighting a rigged war ofattrition with the enemy forces in this war zone.

9 The Phaeron’s Blade: The Necron war effort will be rendered three hundred per cent more efficient if a specific enemydefensive asset or leader is mercilessly eliminated by this kill team.

10 The Phaeron’s Curse: Some insolent member of the lesser races was fool enough to invade a tomb complex and steal apriceless artefact. This kill team will reclaim that artefact, and administer a suitably horrific punishment to the transgressor.

D10 SQUAD QUIRK: GIFT OF AEONS

1 The Curse of Time: So ancient are these warriors, so many times have they been resurrected, that they have becomesomewhat faltering and unreliable.

2 Wreathed in Power: Some artifice of the Crypteks ensures that these warriors’ bodies crackle with a constant energised halo.

3 Deadly Automata: These warriors stalk into battle without hesitation, single-mindedly focused on their objective anduntroubled by the incoming fire of the foe.

4 Dark Sentience: These Necrons are more self-aware and intelligent than most of their kind, able to reason, react and hate…

5 Ether-flux: These warriors have slipped slightly out of sync with time, and flicker in and out of reality like a mirage.

6 Skin-takers: These Necrons are driven to flense their victims at close-quarters.

7 Arrogant Hunters: This kill team looks down upon the lesser races as game-animals to be hunted.

8 Deranged: The Great Sleep has scrambled the mental engrams of these warriors, leaving their actions random and strange.

9 Unfeeling: Hollow and robotic, these warriors show no sign of emotion, personality or conscious thought.

10 Favoured Warriors: The warriors of this kill team have been decorated to demonstrate their Overlord’s power and wealth,and their wargear is of the highest standard.

D10 BACKGROUND: ANCIENT ORIGINS

1 Harbingers: This kill team is just the tip of the iceberg, the first encroaching warband to break this world’s surface and thespearhead for a far greater emergence.

2 Tomb Guardians: These warriors have stood sentry over their tomb complex for countless long years, unsleeping,unfaltering, ever vigilant.

3 Invaders from Beyond: This kill team is part of a wider planetary invasion, forerunners paving the way for a larger assault.

4 The Phaeron’s Chosen: These hand-picked warriors are the elite guards and finest agents of their Overlord.

5 Scouring Party: This kill team is equipped to exterminate the vermin that have infested the demesnes of the Necrontyr.

6 Code-bound: This kill team cleaves to the ancient codes of the Triarch, and would never stoop to the use of dishonourableweapons or tactics.

7 Assassins: These warriors have been drawn together by their unscrupulous Overlord and charged with eliminating keyenemies through use of whatever tactics they see fit.

8 Ghoulish Nightmares: This kill team consists of ghastly flesh-draped Necrons who spread terror amongst the enemy ranks.

9 Mindless Martyrs: This kill team has been constructed specifically to wear down the foe through sheer relentlessness,impassively soaking up firepower only to return from apparent demise again and again.

10 Domination Force: This kill team comprises those warriors that can best – and most violently – demonstrate the Necrons’utter superiority over the lesser races.

151



D10 SPECIALISTS’ DEMEANOURS

1 Menacing: This warrior has a ghastly aspect that spreadsfear amongst the foe.

2
Maniacal: What remains of this warrior’s personality
has been corrupted so far that they do little but emit a
terrible, grating laughter.

3
Strategic: Whether by dint of strategic sub-engrams
or memory artefacts, this warrior is a sound
battlefield tactician.

4 Nihilist: This Necron simply wishes to see a destructiveend to all things.

5 Tormentor: This warrior takes a sadistic delight ininflicting pain upon the lesser races.

6
Glitching: This warrior’s movements are stilted and
halting, and they emit blurts of partial vocalisation as
they act.

7 Obsessive: Whatever this warrior does, they dorepeatedly and to violent excess.

8
Delusional: This warrior is convinced that they are
still flesh and blood, fighting in an ancient war now
long gone.

9
Acquisitive: To this warrior, the Necrons are the rightful
inheritors of everything in the galaxy; they take trophies
and steal wargear with a compulsive urgency.

10
Necrochirurgeon: This warrior is fascinated with the
effects that Necron weaponry have upon the flesh of
living things, and the transition from life to final death.

ORKS
ORKS

The Orks are a galactic menace, a race of hulking,
bellicose aliens who love nothing more than a good
fight, and will devastate entire star systems in their
attempts to find a battle worthy of their time. Their
cobbled-together vehicles and weapons appear crude in
design, but that does not make them any less destructive
on the battlefield – to stand against an Ork assault is to
be enveloped by a tidal wave of primal ferocity that is as
unstoppable as it is terrifying.

Orks are exceptionally straightforward creatures,
whose culture is as robust as it is simple. In greenskin
society, might makes right, and so the largest and
strongest Ork inevitably bullies his way to the top of
the heap. Thus, the Boss Nobz that rule over mobs of
greenskins are muscle-bound, thick-skinned brutes,
while the Warbosses that in turn rule over them are
truly monstrous creatures that command entire tribes or
– in the case of the mightiest leaders – a star-spanning
military migration known as a Waaagh!.

Beyond this simple societal structure, Orks are further
divided into a number of clans, each of which has
distinguishing features, a favoured colour and glyph,
and certain specialities on and off the battlefield.
Whether it be the Evil Sunz, who paint everything red
and are obsessed with speed, the brutal Goffs with their
black armour and love of close-quarters violence, the
rich and showy Bad Moons, the light-fingered looters
of the Deathskulls, the atavistic and tough Snakebites
or the oddly disciplined – and universally mistrusted –
Blood Axes, each Ork clan has its place in Ork society,
and its own favourite ways of making war.

The Orks are the most belligerent and resourceful race in the galaxy. Rampaging across the void in their
billions, the greenskins devastate everything in their path. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on
the following pages, you can generate names and background for your Ork kill teams.

An Ork kill team is comprised of a raucous mob of
greenskins who delight in the rush and crunch of battle.
Its leader is always the biggest and meanest Ork around,
accompanied by those he has managed to bully, cajole
or threaten into following him. Like a green wrecking
ball, this gathering will smash aside anything in its
path. Hollering Orks will fill the air with storms of lead
from their crude shootas, while towering brutes lumber
forwards through the carnage of battle, hacking, bashing
and blasting their foes apart with murderous glee.

The Orks’ great strength and durability make them
excellent hand-to-hand fighters, and most Ork kill
teams eschew such a tedious concern as marksmanship
in favour of closing with the enemy as quickly and
violently as possible, swarming them with sheer
numbers. However, what the greenskins lack in
accuracy they make up for in weight of fire, and their
foes should not discount the cumulative devastation
unleashed by a dozen shootas and burnas blazing away
in deafening unison.

GORK AND MORK
The Orks worship a pair of rumbustious and
belligerent gods known as Gork and Mork,
who embody the greenskin love of violence for
violence’s sake. Gork is said by the Orks to be
brutal but kunnin’, a hulking warrior god who likes
nothing more than to take the most direct route
into the biggest fight he can find. Meanwhile, his
brother Mork is kunnin’ but brutal, a massive war
club hidden just behind his back where it can be
swiftly whipped out and brought crashing down
on his enemies’ heads the moment they look the
other way.

158



D10 MISSION: DA PLAN

1 Kill Their Bosses: This kill team is out to hunt down and kill enemy leaders and specialists.

2 Get Stuck In: Hit ’em hard and keep moving forwards: it’s the greenskin way.

3 Salvage: This kill team must pick over every fallen corpse and piece of machinery to grab everything they can for the Meks.

4 ’Andz off: These ladz are out to protect something the Meks built, and that the enemy want to steal or destroy.

5 We’ll Show ’Em: Each Ork vies to be the one that can ‘bag da most trophies’, with ‘trophies’ here meaning ‘enemy heads’.

6 Da Ambush: The foe is surrounded; now the fun begins. This kill team must launch a surprise attack to wipe out the enemy.

7 Speed Is Its Own Reward: For these Orks, its all about going as fast as they can, because the fastest ladz win.

8 Sneak About: Only Blood Axes leaders would worry about ‘scoutin’ da foe’, and on their orders a small team has been sentout to reconnoitre the area.

9 Fist of Gork (or Mork): As the speartip of a larger attack, this kill team must clear the way for the hordes that follow.

10 Plant da Flag: To claim an area the Orks must wipe out the foe and then ensure all know who did it in the brashest and mostunsubtle way possible.

D10 SQUAD QUIRK: DA KNOW-WOTZ

1 Loud and Tuneless: From amped-up weaponry to deafening warshouts and bellowed Freebooterz space-shanties, this entiresquad values making as much noise as possible.

2 Boastful: Full of bravado and braggadocio, this squad never shuts up about their own violent accomplishments, pointing outand extolling at length each and every one.

3 Itchy: Some sort of rash has been making even the Orks’ leathery hides feel all scratchy, often at the least convenient times…

4 Madboyz: Possibly it was the recent ’ead-butting contest, but the loud, raucously shouted war cries of this crew are entirelyincomprehensible, and their behaviour rather strange.

5 Krumpin’ Krew: This squad revels in the biggest and loudest-struck blows, and have become experts at winding up anddelivering the most brutal of close-combat hits.

6 Hard-bitten: The Orks in this mob boast iron gobs, steel teef or incredibly powerful jaws with which they like to ‘leave theirmark’ upon any who fight them.

7 Lucky Gitz: Whether by sacred keepsakes or lucky blue tattoos, this entire mob has proven to be blessed with good fortuneby Gork and Mork themselves.

8 Pyromaniacs: Every member of this mob enjoys setting things ablaze and knows ‘a burny fing is a good fing’.

9 Buzzsquigs: This mob is overhyped on Buzzsquigs – small snack-sized creatures that boost greenskin energies beyond eventheir usual maniacal levels.

10 Praktical Jokers: Whether it’s stingjaws placed in their fellows’ trousers, slugga-grips loosened while the owner is distracted,or the explosives in a stikkbomb replaced with stink-squigs, this mob will go to any lengths to mess with each other.

D10 BACKGROUND: DA LADZ

1 Gung-ho!: This kill team are glory seekers out to prove themselves, wishing to stand out from their horde-mates with theirdeeds of battle and kunnin’.

2 Filled with Waaagh!: The violent energies of the Waaagh! have filled these greenskins with unnatural enthusiasm for battle.

3 Skraphuntaz: These Orks are driven to hoard scrap, and even if it is bolted down these ladz will steal it (along with the bolts).

4 The Shootiest: When it comes to dakka, these greenskins know how to lay it down, for they love firepower the waySquiggoths love to eat.

5 Sneaky Gits!: This kill team firmly believes that attacking from unexpected quarters is not only thrilling, but good for laughswhen they see the panic in their doomed enemies’ eyes.

6 Brutal: These Orks like to fight up-close and personal, preferring to pummel their foes in hand-to-hand combat.

7 Kunnin’: These Orks know how to rig cruel traps of every variety, and are well known amongst their brethren for using othersneaky tricks like hiding behind cover when the enemy shoots at them.

8 Internal Rivalries: The Orks in this mob are constantly trying to outdo one another, whether because they belong to differenttribes or clans, or just because one of the ladz said he was ‘da best’ and the others are going to prove him wrong or die trying.

9 Addicted to Destruction: These Orks are so keen to wreck everything they see that they will even blast apart terrain if thereare no better targets.

10 Spreaders of the Waaagh!: This kill team believes that the best way to spread the Waaagh! is with shockingly brutal acts ofviolence inflicted upon the foe.

D10 SPECIALISTS’ DEMEANOURS

1
Thick-headed: While this warrior is not overly bright,
they can deliver an ’eadbutt that will dent a plascrete-
reinforced bunker.

2
Heavily Scarred: Other greenskins view so much
battle damage in the same way other races might gaze
upon veterans bedecked with military medals, ribbons,
and honours.

3 Stubborn: With single-minded determination this Orkis set on accomplishing every task in their own way.

4
Light-fingered: This Ork is a master pilferer and they
snatch, steal and loot at all times, ensuring they have
plenty of extra gear should the need arise.

5
Violent Loon: Even by greenskin standards this warrior
is full of aggression, and he does not know the meaning
of the word overkill.

6
Resilient: Too angry to know pain, too full of fight to
slow down, this warrior can shrug off any wound, at
least for a time.

7
Beady-eyed: This Ork is so shrewd that no small detail
escapes his low kunnin, and he knows just where to
place his shot or drive his choppa for maximum effect.

8 Too Dumb to Know Fear: Nothing could dissuade thisOrk from attacking.

9 Foul Gob: None can challenge or taunt the foe with asmuch zeal and mockery as this Ork.

10
Big and Brawny: When this Ork bellows the whole
battlefield can hear it, and he looms over his mates like
a monster.

T’AU EMPIRE
T’AU EMPIRE

The T’au are a young and dynamic race who seek to
spread word of their unifying philosophy – the T’au’va ,
or the Greater Good – throughout the stars. Guided by
the mysterious spiritual leaders known as Ethereals, the
T’au sweep aside any who would deny this universal
truth with the power of their superior technology.
Compared to many species in the galaxy, the T’au race is
still in its infancy, yet the pace at which T’au technology
advances is truly ferocious. Unified by their belief in
the Greater Good, the T’au set aside personal gain and
internal strife, instead pouring all of their considerable
intellect and manufacturing genius into creating ever
more advanced machineries, artificial intelligences and
devastating weapons of war.

The T’au Empire’s efforts at colonisation are similarly
fast-paced and single-minded; each new world
encountered by the T’au is swiftly surveyed and
assessed for assimilation into the latest T’au Sphere.
Any indigenous, sentient beings are offered a simple
choice – join the glory of the Greater Good, contribute
to spreading its light across the stars, or be evicted
through swift and targeted military action. It is this
uncompromising stance that has brought the T’au into
conflict with many of the galaxy’s older races, but to
their credit they continue to push their empire’s borders
ever outwards.

As befitting the T’au Empire’s highly organised and
adaptable forces, T’au kill teams tend to be perfectly
specialised and equipped for their task. The soldiers

The T’au Empire is a rising force in the galaxy. United by the Greater Good, the T’au strive to bring
enlightenment to other races, by force if necessary. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the
following pages, you can generate names and background for your T’au Empire kill teams.

of the Fire caste – the military arm of the empire – are
well used to forming teams comprised of a mix of
troop types in order to maximise combat efficiency.
It is common for the warriors of these kill teams to
undergo the bonding ritual known as ta’lissera – a pact
where each T’au pledges unconditional support to their
comrades. This is the highest form of T’au commitment
to another, and it symbolises the sacrifice of the
individual to become part of a greater whole.

Specialists within a T’au kill team will be combined
and utilised at the discretion of the T’au officer given
command of the mission – most often a veteran
Shas’ui or Shas’vre. In battle, these kill teams operate
as a microcosm of the greater T’au war machine. They
prioritise swift movement and superior firepower,
unbalancing the enemy with cunning counter-attacks,
flanking assaults and ambushes. Melee combat is
generally regarded as a desperate last resort.

DRONES
The T’au make prolific use of artificial intelligences
in every aspect of their society, including dexterous
mechanised assistants in operating theatres and
laboratories, training units in military academies,
and a range of anti-gravitic support drones that
aid their warriors upon the field of battle. Combat
support drones range from simple gun-bearing
modules that add their firepower to that of their
assigned squad, to units that can lock and transmit
targeting data, surround their assigned squad with
a protective force field, interpose themselves like
shields between their operators and imminent
danger, or even send out thrumming gravitic
pulses that drive back charging foes.

the Range characteristic of that model’s pulse pistol,
pulse carbine or pulse rifle by 6".

Recon Suite (MB3 Recon Drone only): At the start of
the Shooting phase, you can choose a PATHFINDER
from your kill team within 6" of a friendly Recon Drone.
Until the end of the phase, that model does not suffer
penalties to their hit and Injury rolls due to their target
being obscured.

TYRANIDS
TYRANIDS

The Tyranids are an utterly alien race that is inimical to
all other forms of life. Sailing the void in vast living craft
known as hive ships, billions of Tyranid bioforms wait
in suspended animation to be woken once more as a
new prey world heaves into view. Guided by the godlike
meta-sentience known as the Hive Mind, countless
splinter fleets of hive ships push into the galaxy from
every direction, tendrils questing through the outer
dark until they find a living, breathing world to wrap
themselves around so that it may be fed upon.

When a Tyranid fleet locates a new world or system to
attack, the immense swarms of weaponised lifeforms
aboard each craft awaken. Hurled down upon the prey
world in spore-like drop craft, the Tyranids attack in
wave after wave, successively larger and more terrifying
monstrosities falling upon the enemy’s defences until
at last every living defender has been dragged down
and devoured. Yet they do not stop there – the Tyranids
break down and ingest every shred of organic matter
on the planet. Their digestion pools roil and spit as
the planet’s biomass is broken down in their churning
depths before being sucked up by the jostling hive
ships. Even the oceans and the atmosphere itself are
consumed, until nothing remains but an arid, lifeless
rock left drifting in the Tyranids’ wake.

Tyranid kill teams are made up of a variety of horrific
bioforms, from swarming packs of savage Gaunts to
towering Tyranid Warriors and other, more specialised
creatures. Each organism is adapted for the sole purpose
of slaughtering other living beings so that their biomass

Driven by an all-consuming imperative to feed, the Tyranids devour entire worlds, leaving them as little
more than barren rocks devoid of all life. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the following
pages, you can generate names and background for your Tyranids kill teams.

may be absorbed and re-purposed by the Tyranid hive
fleets. In place of artificial armour, Tyranids are clad in
organic chitinous plates and possess massive blade-like
claws, row upon row of armour-puncturing fangs, and
projectile weapons wrought of living tissue. Together,
the Tyranids within a kill team function like a single
predatory beast, stalking their prey across desolate
ruinscapes and through darkened underhives before
moving in for the kill.

Tyranid kill teams are despatched to prepare a prey
world for full-scale invasion. Small groups of Tyranid
warrior-organisms are vomited forth by their orbiting
hive ship to infiltrate the planet’s cities and fortresses,
undermine its defences and sow terror throughout its
populace. The Tyranids within such kill teams carry out
their imperative without question, adapting their tactics
with disturbing rapidity to wreak ever more carnage
until their hive fleet arrives.

THE SHADOW IN THE WARP
As a Tyranid hive fleet approaches a prey world,
it casts a pall of psychic disturbance ahead of
it that has become known as the Shadow in
the Warp. This effect has been described as
akin to the chittering of numberless insects, or
the unshakeable feeling of being watched by
a monstrously hungry entity. Not only does it
smother the psychic abilities of those beings caught
within its sphere of influence, it also gnaws at their
sanity until they are driven mad or killed outright.
So do the hive fleets isolate worlds, choking off
their psychic distress cries before they can even
begin to ring out across the void…

174



D10 MISSION: BROOD IMPERATIVE

1 Devour: These warrior-organisms must rip the enemy apart at close quarters and consume as much biomass as they can.

2 Infiltrate: This kill team seeks to bypass the prey’s defences, laying a pheromone trail for subsequent attack waves to follow.

3 Cull: The prey’s leaders and specialists must be exterminated to facilitate a swift victory for the Hive Mind.

4 Swarm: If the prey are able to press their attack in this region, the Hive Mind’s efforts will suffer. Their advance must beslowed with ichor and chitin, the mouths of their guns choked with corpses.

5 Terrify: The prey are strong here. The kill team must spread panic and confusion to weaken their defences.

6 Rampage: The task of this kill team is simple: to cause as much indiscriminate destruction and bloodshed as they can, for aslong as they can.

7 Stalk: This kill team must hunt the prey carefully, preserving their own biomass while striking only where they areguaranteed to whittle down that of the foe.

8 Spread: The hides of these warrior-organisms have been altered to spew Tyranid spores that corrode machinery andinorganic structures. They must spread the entropic touch of these spores as far as they can.

9 Protect: The prey are drawing perilously close to a crucial synaptic node. They must be driven back at all costs.

10 Shroud: The Shadow in the Warp must be extended by devouring the prey’s protective psykers.

D10 SQUAD QUIRK: BROOD STRAIN

1 Ravenous: This brood seeks to devour biomass at all costs, and their hunger is never sated.

2 Cautious: This brood probes carefully, and will swiftly pull back to try another route of attack if danger threatens.

3 Slinking: The beasts of this brood scurry through sewer pipes and crawl through ducts to attack from unexpected quarters.

4 Bladed Shoal: These warrior-organisms flock together in perfect synchronicity, moving as one across the battlefield.

5 Inescapable Hunters: These beasts stalk their prey relentlessly and will pursue them without rest or mercy.

6 Shrieker Brood: These warrior-organisms are adapted to utter horrifying predatory shrieks as they storm into battle.

7 Sizzling Gore: These creatures have concentrated bio-acid running through their bodies that bursts out to spray those whowound them.

8 Heightened Senses: These beasts have specially honed sensory biomorphs that allow them to react with near-prescient speedto the actions of their prey.

9 Shorn of Synapse: This brood has gone beyond the reach of the Hive Mind, and now acts on predatory instinct alone.

10 Catalysed: When these bioforms attack, they do so in a violent frenzy that sees them hurl themselves at the enemy withsuicidal ferocity.

D10 BACKGROUND: BROOD CLASSIFICATION

1 Stealth Brood: This kill team comprises beasts that are highly adapted to slinking unseen through the enemy lines.

2 Devourer Brood: These Tyranids excel in rapidly breaking down and devouring the biomass of their enemies.

3 Swiftkiller Brood: This kill team is made up of fast, hard-hitting warrior-organisms.

4 Highcrawler Brood: This kill team comprises agile, lightweight beasts that stay high and strike from rooftops and gantries.

5 Bombardment Brood: These warrior-organisms are specialised for ranged combat, picking their enemies off inferocious firefights.

6 Kill-swarm: This kill team uses numbers to its advantage, flooding the combat zone with expendable organisms.

7 Living Barricade: These war beasts are thickly armoured in chitin and bone, able to soak up tremendous punishment as theyoverwhelm their foes.

8 Alpha Pack: This kill team comprises elite organisms, their numbers small but their combat abilities fearsome.

9 Ambush Brood: These lethal hunter-killer organisms excel at laying for long periods of time in wait for their prey beforebursting forth to slaughter them.

10 Kingslayer Brood: This kill team comprises a mix of bioforms designed to work together to eliminate any target no matterhow well defended. Some have been spawned to track their prey, some to make the kill, and others to devour its remains.

D10 SPECIALISTS’ BIO-ADAPTATIONS

1 Hive Node: This beast amplifies the control of the HiveMind over nearby warrior-organisms.

2 Sentient Ammunition: The bio-shot from this creature’sweapons is able to actively seek out its targets.

3
Entangling Tendrils: Clumps of revolting frond-like
pseudopods sprout from this beast’s hide, entangling
enemies with their clammy touch.

4
Synaptophage: This beast can devour the brain matter
of its foes to glean some instinctive understanding of
their plans and secrets.

5 Guardian Beast: This Tyranid’s behaviour leads it toviciously pursue those who threaten its broodkin.

6
Survival Instincts: This beast possesses something akin
to a sixth sense for danger, leaving the prey panicking as
their cunning ambushes and booby traps catch nothing
but air.

7 Bloodhunger: With every victim this beast devours, itsmetabolism accelerates and its ferocity increases.

8
Unsettling Presence: This beast emits a disturbing echo
of the Shadow in the Warp, leaving nearby enemies
uncomfortable and on edge.

9
Lurker: Where possible, this beast sticks to the shadows,
slinking towards the enemy through the densest cover
it can find.

10
Mimic: Through convulsions of bio-resonators in
its thoracic cavity, this beast can mimic words and
sounds uttered by its prey, luring them into traps or
horrifying them.

GENESTEALER CULTS
GENESTEALER CULTS

Genestealer Cults arise from the heaving masses of
Humanity that make up the Imperium. Sprawling
clandestine networks of desperate and downtrodden
individuals, each cult is bound by a fanatical belief that
they will be delivered from oppression by star-borne
saviours, a destiny towards which they are guided by the
insidious whispers of their monstrous Patriarch.

In truth, the Genestealer Cultists have been lied to in
the cruellest and most invasive way imaginable. Their
beloved Patriarch is, in fact, a Genestealer, a Tyranid
vanguard organism that uses its parasitic Genestealer’s
Kiss to inject genetic material into unwitting human
hosts. These victims, brought into the Genestealer’s
thrall by its foul touch, pass on that material to
successive generations of Acolytes and Neophytes until
the cult has proliferated through the underclasses of
whatever world is unfortunate enough to harbour it.

Over time, a well-established Genestealer Cult will
extend tendrils into the upper reaches of a world’s
Ecclesiarchy, military and government, working always
towards the day when the great uprising can begin
and the star gods be welcomed with open arms. When
that moment comes, the warriors of the cult fight
with fanatical zeal and absolute devotion, compelled
by the xenos seed permeating their physiology and
indoctrinated into the belief that – when the star gods
arrive to validate their selfless quest – all those found
worthy will be taken up into paradise, there to enjoy
a blessed transcendence. In a terrible way, when the
ravenous hive fleets appear in the skies above the cult’s
world, this belief holds an aspect of truth…

From dark depths and shadowy streets emerge the Genestealer Cultists, sinister figures united by a
worship of inscrutable star-borne entities. By rolling the appropriate dice on the tables on the following
pages, you can generate names and background for your Genestealer Cults kill teams.

Genestealer Cults kill teams initiate their brutal
insurrections armed with the tools supplied by their
oppressors, the industrial gear with which they have
been forced to toil for generations. Drills, saws, cutting
lasers and demolition charges, along with basic firearms
that are stolen or cobbled together, are put to violent
use against their enemies. Those members of a kill
team blessed with more advanced mutations fight with
diamond-hard claws and fangs, gutting with savage
frenzy those who oppose their cult’s uprising.

Wherever a Genestealer Cult exists, kill teams composed
of disparate insurrectionists group together to sabotage
and slaughter their foes. Such kill teams often emerge
from deep within the fabric of planet’s society, or they
may arrive on a world via freighters and transports,
having infiltrated work crews, pilgrimages or colonising
expeditions. These kill teams fight with unflinching faith
in their eventual deliverance, and will turn their fury
upon any foreign invaders who come to take their world
from them before their saviours arrive.

LORDS OF THE CULT
As a Genestealer Cult grows, mutant strains
appear from amongst its later generations. Some
are Aberrants, genetic mishaps useful only as
shock troops and line-breakers. Yet there are
others whose purpose is far closer to the divine.
The Primus, for example, serves as the cult’s war
leader, a charismatic general with an instinctive
knowledge of battlefield tactics. The Magus,
meanwhile, acts as the Patriarch’s vizier, extending
their potent psychic influence to twist the minds
of loyal officials and force the cult’s enemies to
surrender their wills to that of the Patriarch.

Genestealer Cult Kill Teams
GENESTEALER CULT KILL TEAMS
If every model in your kill team has the GENESTEALER CULTS Faction keyword, you can use Genestealer
Cults Tactics.

Purestrain Genestealers: When you add a Genestealer (pg 179) to your command roster (and create its datacard)
you can choose for it to have the GENESTEALER CULTS Faction keyword instead of the TYRANIDS Faction keyword.

UNNATURAL SENSES

Genestealer Cults Tactic
Use this Tactic when a model from your kill team
is declared as a target of a charge. That model may
fire Overwatch at the charging model, even if the
charging model is not visible to it. The target is
treated as obscured.

1 COMMAND POINT

DENSITY ANALYSIS LENSES

Genestealer Cults Tactic
Use this Tactic when you choose a model in your
kill team to shoot in the Shooting phase. Add 1
to hit rolls for that model against targets which
are obscured.

2 COMMAND POINTS

FRENZIED HAMMERING

Genestealer Cults Tactic
Use this Tactic when an ABERRANT from your
kill team armed with a power hammer attacks
in the Fight phase. Increase that model’s Attacks
characteristic by D3 until the end of the phase, but
subtract 1 from hit rolls for that model’s attacks
until the end of the phase.

2 COMMAND POINTS

STRENGTH OF FAITH

Genestealer Cults Tactic
Use this Tactic when a model from your kill team
suffers a mortal wound in the Psychic phase. Roll a
D6 for that mortal wound, and each other mortal
wound suffered by that model until the end of the
phase. On a roll of 5+ that wound is ignored and
has no effect.

1 COMMAND POINT

INDUSTRIAL BRUTALITY

Genestealer Cults Tactic
Use this Tactic after making attacks with a model
armed with a heavy rock drill, heavy rock saw or
heavy rock cutter in the Fight phase. Roll a D6. On
a 4+ that model may immediately fight again.

1 COMMAND POINT

INHUMAN REFLEXES

Genestealer Cults Tactic
Use this Tactic when a model from your kill team
fails a Falling test. It doesn’t suffer falling damage,
and won’t fall on another model. If it would,
instead place this model as close as possible to the
point where it would have landed. This can bring it
within 1" of an enemy model.

1 COMMAND POINT

‘Now is the time, brothers and sisters! Cast off the shackles of Imperial oppression! Embrace the love of
the Four-Armed Emperor. Cry rapturous welcome to the Star Children, for with their coming we shall all be
raised up to a higher state of unified glory. Praise be, brothers and sisters, for the Day of Ascension is upon
us!’

KILL TEAM CAMPAIGNS

KILL TEAM
CAMPAIGNS
Kill Team campaigns let you collect operatives and fight battles of Kill Team in a series of connected
missions. These form a narrative of covert battles fought alongside a greater war, where the skirmishes you
fight have an impact far beyond the battlefields you are contesting.

Kill Team can be played and enjoyed in one-off missions
– you do not need to use these extra rules in your
games. However, playing through a campaign can be
a fun and rewarding alternative, giving you and your
friends the opportunity to write the story of your own
kill teams, charting their successes and failures as they
grow in experience. In the end, one of you will be able to
claim the glory of total victory!

In order to take part in a Kill Team campaign, you
will need two or more players. All players will need
a collection of Citadel Miniatures, which they will
organise into kill teams. For more detail about choosing
your kill team for a mission, see the opposite page.

The players fight missions against each other using the
kill teams they create. The combatants in each mission
gain experience, and may become more skilled or
stronger as the campaign progresses (see page 66). In
addition, the outcome of each mission will affect the
wider war being fought, as described below. The more
success a player has in their missions, the more likely it
is that they will be crowned victor of the campaign.

THE WAR EFFORT
The missions that your operatives are fighting are
part of a larger war effort, and the mission your kill
team undertakes has an impact on this war. If you
succeed in your sabotage mission, your opponent’s
materiel is severely depleted. If you cannot stop enemy
assassination missions, your force’s morale plunges!

The fluctuating fortunes of the different factions in the
war, and your impact on these, are represented by four
resources: Intelligence, Materiel, Morale and Territory.

• Intelligence: A faction’s spy networks and intelligence
gathering assets.

• Materiel: A faction’s military resources, whether it be
weaponry, armour, transport or more esoteric items.

• Morale: A faction’s will to keep fighting, whether
through nobility, determination, hatred or spite.

• Territory: A measure of the locations and facilities
currently controlled by the faction.

If a faction runs out of any one of these resources,
their armies will crumble and they will be reduced to
guerrillas in this conflict. You will need to guard your
resources while striking at your enemies’ weakest points.

Each player begins a campaign with a set number of
resource points. We suggest starting the campaign
with 8 points in each resource, but you can agree with
the other players that you will all start with a different
number, or even different numbers in each resource (for
example, you might have D6+3 points for each resource,
giving each player their own strengths and weaknesses).
Note your starting resources on your command roster.

Each mission tells you what impact the mission has on
the resources of the players that take part in it. After the
mission, record any changes to each player’s resources
on their roster sheet. Once you have done so, any player
who has been reduced to 0 or less in any resource is
reduced to a guerrilla faction. This is explained in more
detail on page 205.

VICTORY
Unless the players in the campaign agree otherwise
at the beginning of the campaign, the last player who
hasn’t been reduced to a guerrilla faction wins the
campaign – theirs is the only force with the cohesion
and the means to secure victory over all others!

If the only remaining non-guerrilla factions are
reduced to guerrilla factions after the same mission,
the campaign will be decided by sudden death. At this
point, anyone can win! This is described in more detail
on page 205.

You can instead decide at the beginning of the campaign
to set your own victory condition – this might be when
one player has won a certain numbers of victories, or
the player with the highest combined total of resources
after a certain number of games have been played. It’s
up to you!

Mission Critical

CHOOSING A MISSION
You can arrange to fight missions as and when you
wish, and can use any Kill Team mission that is available
to you. Either choose a mission that you and your
opponent(s) want to play, or roll off, and the winner rolls
2D6 and consults the following table. Where a mission
has an attacker and a defender, whichever player has
more Territory than the other is the defender. If there is
a tie, the players roll off – whoever wins is the attacker:

CHOOSING A KILL TEAM
Once you have chosen a mission, the players choose
kill teams using the rules for choosing a Battle-forged
kill team (see page 62) subject to the mission you are
playing, with the following exception: they must each
choose their kill team from their campaign command
roster (see below). Players choose their kill teams
in secret – they will be revealed together once the
battlefield has been set up. We suggest that each player
keeps the Faction keyword they chose for the length of
the campaign.

CAMPAIGN COMMAND ROSTER
Each player in a campaign has a campaign command
roster, from which they choose their kill team for each
mission. This roster is created in the same way as for a
matched play command roster (see page 62), with the
following difference: it starts with up to twelve models,

rather than up to twenty, and can grow beyond twenty
models as the campaign progresses.

If a player has already played a mission in the campaign,
they can choose their kill team from any of the models
on their campaign command roster but they can also
choose to add new models with new datacards to their
kill team (though see Adding Members to a Fire Team
on page 205), or even use a kill team chosen entirely
from new models. Each time a player completes a
datacard for a model that they add to their kill team, they
should also record that model’s details on their roster.
Adding new models to their kill team for a mission in
this way is the only way for players in a campaign to
increase the number of models on their roster.

The campaign command roster therefore becomes a
record of all of the models that you have used in the
campaign, and comes to represent the ‘pool’ of Kill
Team models available for you to choose kill teams
from. A player might, on their command roster, have
models from every specialism, and a number of Leaders.
However, they need to choose a kill team from their
campaign command roster (and any new models)
that matches the restrictions for each mission. This
means that kill teams will often be made up of a mix of
experienced and new models, and players will need to
balance the flexibility of using their whole collection
against the reliability of using certain stalwarts.

PLAY THE MISSION
Once you have decided on a mission and the players
have chosen their kill teams, play the mission!

STRATEGIC WITHDRAWAL
At the end of the third battle round, and at the end of
each subsequent battle round, before any dice roll to
determine whether or not the battle ends, a player can
make a strategic withdrawal. Players make the decision
about whether or not to do so in the order determined
in the Initiative phase. If a player makes a strategic
withdrawal, they lose the mission – if there is only one
other player remaining, that player wins the mission.
When a player makes a strategic withdrawal, all of their
models are removed from the battlefield. They must roll
a dice for each model with one or more flesh wounds
when they do so to determine whether or not they go
out of action, as described in Casualties (see overleaf).

MISSION CRITICAL
Following the orders of their commanders, kill teams battle in the darkness of a nightmarish and war-torn
landscape. The leaders of these teams play games of cat and mouse with their foes amidst monolithic
refineries and tangled hab-complexes, leading their squads in daring strikes against their enemies.

Consequences
Of Battle

CONSEQUENCES OF BATTLE

After each mission, each player who took part in the
mission should play through the following steps.

1. Resources

2. Casualties

3. Experience

Once the players have all completed this sequence, it’s
time to start planning the next mission!

RESOURCES
Each player should update the resources listed on their
command roster as described in the mission. Players
may find themselves reduced to guerrillas at this point,
as described opposite, and if there is only one non-
guerrilla faction left, that player wins (unless you agreed
on a different way to end your campaign).

CASUALTIES
Each player should roll a D6 for each model from their
kill team on the battlefield that has one or more flesh
wounds. On a roll of 1-3, that model recovers. On a roll
of 4-6, that model goes out of action.

Each player then makes a Casualty roll for each of their
models that is out of action at the end of a mission by
rolling a D10 and consulting the following table:

After making any casualty rolls, each player removes all
flesh wounds from their models.

EXPERIENCE
Then, the members of your kill team progress as
described below, becoming even more formidable as
they gain experience.

Specialists
Each specialist in your kill team gains an experience
point – check one of the experience boxes on their
datacard. They also gain an experience point at the end
of the mission if you used at least one Tactic from their
specialism. Check the boxes left to right; when you
check a box with an orange outline, your specialist has
reached the next level – a Level 1 specialist becomes
Level 2, and so on. You can then choose a new ability
for them as described on page 66, and you may also gain
access to new Tactics for that fighter. Once you have
checked all the boxes on the model’s datacard, it cannot
progress any further – every fighter has their limits!

Fire Teams
The other models in your kill team may not be
specialists, but they are all learning a thing or two
during these covert operations, and their bonds of
camaraderie are growing!

The non-specialist models in your collection are
organised into fire teams, where each fire team consists
of all of the non-specialist models chosen from a single
datasheet. For example, if you had 6 Rangers on your
command roster (not counting specialists), those 6
Rangers would be a fire team.

As long as two or more models from a single fire team
were in your kill team and are not dead as a result
of Casualty rolls, all models in that fire team (even
those who did not take part in the mission) gain an
experience point. In addition, all models in a fire team
gain an experience point at the end of the mission if at
least one enemy model was taken out of action by an
attack made or psychic power manifested by a member
of that fire team. Check these points of experience on
your models’ datacards in the same way as described
above. When you check a box with an orange outline,
all models in that fire team have reached the next level –
Level 1 models become Level 2, and so on. At each level,
roll a D6 and consult the table on the opposite page to
see what advance your fire team gains. All members of
the fire team gain this advance. Each fire team can only
gain each advance once – if you roll a result you have
already rolled, re-roll until you roll a new result.

As the dust settles after a battle, each side retreats to count the cost. Territory may be won or lost, and
morale may suffer a devastating blow. Whatever happens, the fighters in each kill team come away with
new experience and scars, gaining in value even as they prepare for their next death-or-glory mission.

CASUALTY ROLL

D10 RESULT

1
Dead: The model is dead! It can no longer be included in
your kill team – discard or erase its datacard and delete
it from your command roster.

2 Convalescence: The model cannot be used in your nextmission. Check the Convalescence box on its datacard.

3-8 Full Recovery: The model makes a full recovery and canbe used in your next mission.

9-10
Hard Knocks: The model makes a full recovery as
described above, and if it is a specialist it gains an
additional experience point (see right).

204



Once you have checked all the boxes on a fire team’s
datacards, it cannot progress any further.

Crack Troops
As your fire teams grow in experience, so their worth
increases. In a Battle-forged kill team, this greater value
is accompanied by an increased cost for each member of
that fire team, as shown in this table:

Fire Team Cost per model
Level 1 +0 points
Level 2 +1 point
Level 3 +2 points
Level 4 +3 points

ADDING MEMBERS TO A FIRE TEAM
Even as your fire teams grow in experience, you can
recruit new members to replace losses or to expand
their presence in your kill team. However, your green
recruits will take some breaking in!

When choosing your kill team for a mission as
described on the previous page, you can add a new
member to a fire team: take the appropriate model and
fill in a datacard for it. You must include it in your kill
team in this mission. You can even do this with multiple
new members if you like. For each new member you
include in your kill team you must include at least one
experienced member of the fire team (to ‘show them the
ropes’). This means if you only have one member of a
fire team remaining, you can only include a single new
member alongside them in a mission.

In their first mission, new members of a fire team
cannot use the advances that the fire team has earned
– check the New Recruit box on their datacard to show
this. At the end of the mission, you can erase the check
and fill in their experience points so that they have the
same number as the other members in their fire team.
They also gain the fire team’s advances at this point.

Note that, if all members of a fire team are dead as a
result of your Casualty rolls, their experience is lost! You
cannot add new members to a fire team that has been
wiped out in this way.

A player can choose to disband a fire team after a
mission. When they do so, they discard or erase all
datacards for that fire team and delete them from their
command roster. They can then add a new fire team
chosen from the same datasheet to their kill team in the
next mission.

GUERRILLA FACTIONS
When a player has had one or more of their
resources reduced to 0 or less, they are reduced to
a guerrilla faction. A guerrilla faction has had their
strength broken, and fights without central leadership
or territory they can call their own. A guerrilla faction
cannot normally win a campaign, with the exception of
a campaign that is decided by sudden death (see below).

A guerrilla faction has no resources and cannot gain
resources, but otherwise they take part in missions like
any other player. In this way they can still take part in
the campaign, and have an impact on who wins in the
end. If a guerrilla faction is very successful, they may
even manage to manipulate events so that they have a
shot at victory!

A guerrilla faction cannot add new members to a fire
team. They can, however, disband a fire team in the
same way as described above.

SUDDEN DEATH
If all non-guerrilla players are reduced to guerrillas
after the same mission, the campaign enters sudden
death! At this point, any player can win, as there is no
faction in the lead. Play a game of Kill Team using any
mission that allows all players in the campaign to play
at once. If you cannot agree on a mission, determine
one randomly. Whoever wins the mission wins the
campaign! If there is no victor, resolve the steps after
the mission as normal, and then play another game as
described above. Repeat this until a victor is decided.

ESCALATION
If all players agree, after a set point in the campaign (it
could be after a certain number of battles have been
played, or after a certain number of weeks – it’s up
to you) you can increase the size of the kill teams to
represent the increasing resources being poured into
this escalating conflict. If you do so, your Battle-forged
kill teams can cost up to 150 points (though you should
still apply any adjustments to this total as described in
the mission you are playing).

D6 RESULT
1 Fleet: Add 1" to this model’s Move characteristic.

2 Lucky: You can re-roll save rolls of 1 for this model.

3 Courageous: You can re-roll failed Nerve tests forthis model.

4

Skilled: Choose one:
- You can re-roll hit rolls of 1 for this model when it

makes shooting attacks.
- You can re-roll hit rolls of 1 for this model in the

Fight phase.

5

Lethal: Choose one:
- You can re-roll wound rolls of 1 for this model when it

makes shooting attacks.
- You can re-roll wound rolls of 1 for this model in the

Fight phase.

6 Die-hard: You can subtract 1 from Injury rolls forthis model.
